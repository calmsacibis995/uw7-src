# ISL case post-reboot
# normal pkgadd senario
# While we do not currently have any need to distinguish these, we may
# need to in the future.

# the postinstall script used to check for the existence of this file
# and source in all .bcfg files, copy the existing drivers to 
# /etc/inst/nics/preserve and idinstall -d the driver currently in use.  
# this is no longer necessary for Gemini.
