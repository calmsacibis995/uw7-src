Plug and Play Support Preliminary Design Overview

Intro
-----
Basic Plug and Play functions will be handled by Don Wooten's Plug and Play
driver.  This driver provides a set of ioctl()'s which will be used by the
Audio Configuration Manager to handle Plug and Play sound cards.

Startup
-------
The Audio Configuration Manager will ask the Plug and Play driver via an
ioctl() for a list of Plug and Play devices in the machine.
Audioconfig will compare this list with the list of known installed soundcards.
If there is a new plug and play soundcard, we will then ask the plug and play
driver for any known configuration of the card's resources such as IOs, IRQs,
and DMAs.
At this point we have two desing choices:
1) Create a new dialog that prompts the user to say "Hey, there's a new
soundcard in your box, do you want to configure it?"
or 2) Immediatley drop the user into the Modify dialog.
If we use 2 this assumes a yes answer to 1 and the user can hit Cancel
if they didn't want to confiure the card.

Modify
------
After completion of the Modify dialog we update the resmgr with the new card
resource values.
If we are dealing with a Plug and Play card we then perform an ioctl() to tell
the Plug and Play driver to initialize the card.
This can be either an ioctl that gives the specific data structure to push down
to the card (which we got from the earlier query to the PnP driver) or it could
be an ioctl that tells the PnP driver to reread the resmgr and initialize all
the PnP cards it finds there.

Remove
------
If the user uses the Remove dialog to remove a card, we now need to update
the resmgr and we may want to tell the PnP driver to uninitialize the card.
