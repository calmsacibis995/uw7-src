* Semaphore Configuration Parameters -------------

*
* Note: All data structures for the semaphore IPC are dynamically
*	allocated as needed.  Feel free to be liberal.
*
*		Default	Min	Max
*               -------	---	---
* SEMMAP total # of entries in semaphore map (unused since SVR4.2).
SEMMAP		0	0	0

* SEMMNI total # of semaphore identifiers in system at one time.
*	Now autotuned. (see $ROOT/etc/conf/autotune.d/ipc).

* SEMMNS total # of semaphores in system.  Unenforced/unused.
* Range of values left as-is in case old applications idtune it.
SEMMNS	60	60	2500

* SEMMNU total # of sem_undo structures in system at one time
* (unenforced in SVR4.2, hence unused).  Now limited by (NPROC * SEMUME).
SEMMNU		0	0	0

* SEMMSL max # of semaphores per semaphore id.
SEMMSL		 150	25	300

* SEMOPM max # of operations per semop call.
SEMOPM		10	10	20

* SEMUME max # of undo entries per process (regulates size of a process'
* array of struct sem_undo's).
SEMUME		10	10	20

* SEMVMX maximum value of a semaphore.
* Do not change this lightly (this value must fit in a signed short word).
SEMVMX		32767	32767	32767

* SEMAEM adjust on exit max value.
SEMAEM		16384	16384	16384

* Shared Memory Parameters ----------

* SHMMIN: minimum size for a single shared memory segment
SHMMIN		1	1	1

* SHMMAX: maximum size for a single shared memory segment
SHMMAX		524288	131072	2147483647

*SHMMNI: the total number of shared memory identifiers in the system 
SHMMNI		100	10	1000

*SHMSEG: the number of shared memory identifiers allowed per process 
SHMSEG		6	6	15

* SHMALL: Unused.
SHMALL		512	256	2048

* Dynamic Shared Memory Parameters ----------

* DSHMMIN: minimum size for a single dynamic shared memory segment
DSHMMIN		512	512	512

* DSHMMNI: the total number of dynamic shared memory identifiers in the system 
DSHMMNI		100	10	1000

* DSHMSEG: the number of dynamic shared memory identifiers allowed per process 
DSHMSEG		6	6	15

* System V IPC Message Queue Parameters ---------------
*
* NOTE: In SVR4.2, MSGMAP is unused (we do not use resource maps),
* all memory for message queues is dynamically allocated as needed.
* It is suggested that MSGTQL be made relatively large to avoid
* blocking for a message header reservation.  (MSGTQL is autotuned --
* see $ROOT/etc/conf/autotune.d/ipc.)  MSGMNI, the maximum number of 
* messages in the system, is also set in the autotune file.
* The total amount of memory which can be allocated for message
* queues is limited by (msginfo.msgssz * msginfo.msgseg).
* Only the product of these two is important, neither is used on its own.
* MSGMNB is the maximum number of bytes on a message queue.
*
*
*		Default	Min	Max
*		-------	---	---
MSGMAP		0	0	0
MSGMAX		2048	512	131072
MSGMNB		4096	4096	131072
MSGSSZ		16384	8192	1048576
MSGSEG		1	1	1
