%% Parallel Printer Driver (lp) Parameters
%C Parallel Printer Driver (lp) Parameters
These parameters control the behaviour of the Parallel Printer
Driver.
% LP0SELECT
Indicates whether the SELECTIN signal on parallel printer port 0
should be asserted to select a printer.

Some IEEE 1284 compliant printers do not operate correctly if 
SELECTIN is asserted when printing.  Note that many printers which
are not IEEE 1284 compliant ignore SELECTIN anyway.

If SELECTIN is to be asserted whilst printing, set LP0SELECT to 1.

If SELECTIN is NOT to be asserted whilst printing, set LP0SELECT
to 0.
% LP1SELECT
Indicates whether the SELECTIN signal on parallel printer port 1
should be asserted to select a printer.

Some IEEE 1284 compliant printers do not operate correctly if 
SELECTIN is asserted when printing.  Note that many printers which
are not IEEE 1284 compliant ignore SELECTIN anyway.

If SELECTIN is to be asserted whilst printing, set LP0SELECT to 1.

If SELECTIN is NOT to be asserted whilst printing, set LP0SELECT
to 0.
% LP2SELECT
Indicates whether the SELECTIN signal on parallel printer port 2
should be asserted to select a printer.

Some IEEE 1284 compliant printers do not operate correctly if 
SELECTIN is asserted when printing.  Note that many printers which
are not IEEE 1284 compliant ignore SELECTIN anyway.

If SELECTIN is to be asserted whilst printing, set LP0SELECT to 1.

If SELECTIN is NOT to be asserted whilst printing, set LP0SELECT
to 0.
% LP3SELECT
Indicates whether the SELECTIN signal on parallel printer port 3
should be asserted to select a printer.

Some IEEE 1284 compliant printers do not operate correctly if 
SELECTIN is asserted when printing.  Note that many printers which
are not IEEE 1284 compliant ignore SELECTIN anyway.

If SELECTIN is to be asserted whilst printing, set LP0SELECT to 1.

If SELECTIN is NOT to be asserted whilst printing, set LP0SELECT
to 0.
