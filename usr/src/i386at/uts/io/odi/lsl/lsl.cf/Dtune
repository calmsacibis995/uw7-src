%% Open DataLink Interface Parameters
% ATM_FRAME_SIZE
Specifies the largest supported size of an ATM frame.
% ETH_FRAME_SIZE
Specifies the largest supported size of an ethernet frame.
% TOK_FRAME_SIZE
Specifies the largest supported size of a token ring frame.
% FDDI_FRAME_SIZE
Specifies the largest supported size of a FDDI frame.
% LSL_1KCHUNKS
Specifies the number of 1024 byte chunks
of memory pre-allocated for ODI (Open DataLink Interface) drivers.
Typically, each driver requires four of these chunks of memory.
This parameter is used only if ODI version 3.1 drivers
are installed in the system,
and the driver supports cards that do Bus Mastering DMA.
% LSL_2KCHUNKS
Specifies the number of 2048 byte chunks
of memory pre-allocated for ODI (Open DataLink Interface) drivers.
Typically, each driver requires 48 of these chunks of memory.
This parameter is used only if ODI version 3.1 drivers
are installed in the system,
and the driver supports cards that do Bus Mastering DMA.
% LSL_6KCHUNKS
Specifies the number of 6144 byte chunks
of memory pre-allocated for ODI (Open DataLink Interface) drivers.
Typically, each driver requires four of these chunks of memory.
This parameter is used only if ODI version 3.1 drivers
are installed in the system,
and the driver supports cards that do Bus Mastering DMA.
% LSL_10KCHUNKS
Specifies the number of 10240 byte chunks
of memory pre-allocated for ODI (Open DataLink Interface) drivers.
Typically, each driver requires two of these chunks of memory.
This parameter is used only if ODI version 3.1 drivers
are installed in the system,
and the driver supports cards that do Bus Mastering DMA.
% LSL_36KCHUNKS
Specifies the number of 36864 byte chunks
of memory pre-allocated for ODI (Open DataLink Interface) drivers.
Typically, each driver requires zero of these chunks of memory.
This parameter is used only if ODI version 3.1 drivers
are installed in the system,
and the driver supports cards that do Bus Mastering DMA.
