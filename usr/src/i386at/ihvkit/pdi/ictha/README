#ident	"@(#)ihvkit:pdi/ictha/README	1.4.2.3"

The current directory contains all of the files necessary to natively build
and install a non-SCSI tape driver.  Observe the following precautions
before building and installing the driver:

1) Read the commented section of hba.h and initialize sdi.h to the appropriate
value:

	#define PDI_VERSION	1  for UNIXWARE 1.1

On a UnixWare-2.0 system, the hba.h already contains the correct
value (#define PDI_VERSION 4).

2) Make sure that the hardware is configured for the various system parameter
values: IRQ, I/O, addr, etc as provided in ictha.cf/System.

3) The current directory contains a separate set of configuration files to
be used when compiling this driver on a 1.1 platform.  Save the 
configuration files under ictha.cf (2.0 version of config files) and 
replace them with the 1.1 versions available under uw_1.1.cf.  After the
replacement has been done, move the hba.h file to the ictha source directory.

4)  To get a complete top down compile and install of the driver
execute make with the following options:

	make -f ictha.mk clean install

If you want the ictha driver package to be transfered to an HBA 
floppy along with a loadable image of the driver (for load on
install), execute the makefile with the following option:

	make -f ictha.mk hbafloppy

NOTE:  Ensure that both the packaging tools and ksh are currently
available on the system before trying to generate the HBA floppy.
Also make sure you that you have a 3 1/2 inch diskette in your floppy
drive before executing this command.

The packaging tools are available as a part of the "softint" package
and the ksh is available along with the "advanced commands" package.

Verify the presence of the packaging tools by executing:

	pkginfo -l softint

Verify the presence of the advanced commands by executing:

	pkginfo -l cmds

Notes
_____

For a better understanding of the layout and use of the HBA floppies,
refer to the READMEs located under:

/usr/src/ihvkit/pdi/ihvhba/ihvhba.bldscript 

The directory ictha.hbafloppy contains the following files:

bldscript:  Used to package the driver and build an HBA floppy.

ictha/copyright:  Copyright file for the driver package.

ictha/pkginfo:  Information about the ictha driver package.

ictha/postinstall:  Postinstall script used during driver package installation.

ictha/preremove:  Preremove script used during driver package removal.

ictha/prototype:  Listing of all the components that make up the ictha
		  driver package.

etc/HBAINST:  A script used during the second phase of the installation
	      using the HBA floppy.

The makefile option that creates the HBA floppy, copies the necessary
driver component files Driver.o, ictha.h, ictha (loadable image),
Space.c, System, Master, Drvmap, loadmods to the necessary sub-directories
under ictha.hbafloppy/ictha/tmp/ictha.  In addition, it invokes the
"bldscript" to format the floppy, make the file system, build the driver
packages and eventually transfer the package to the media.

NOTE: When building the 1.1 version of the HBA floppy modify the
makefile to remove the Drvmap file from the list of installable objects
(Makefile variable OBJECTS), as well as in the prototype file located in
ictha.hbafloppy/ictha. The Drvmap files are needed for autoconfig-ready
2.0 drivers.  In addition, the "bldscript" must be modified, so that
the '-c' option is added to the two lines where the pkgmk command could
be run.

Note2:  Because the idtools for UnixWare 1.1 do not contain the functionality
to generate a viable Driver.o from the loadable module, and the Drvmap file
does not exist for this release, several additional modifications must be
made to the installation and build scripts.

	1) Add 'Driver.o' to the list of OBJECTS in the Makefile.

	2) Within the ictha.hbafloppy/ictha/postinstall script, make the
	   changes:

	Remove the 4 consecutive lines:

                        if [ -f $SVDIR/drvmap.d/$PKGINST ]
                        then
                                cp $SVDIR/drvmap.d/$PKGINST /etc/conf/drvmap.d
                        fi

	Remove the 7 consecutive lines:

                if [ ! -d $SVDIR/drvmap.d ]
                then
                        mkdir $SVDIR/drvmap.d 2>&1 >/dev/null
                fi
                mv /etc/conf/drvmap.d/$PKGINST $SVDIR/drvmap.d
                mv /tmp/$PKGINST/Drvmap /etc/conf/drvmap.d/$PKGINST
                [ $? -ne 0 ] && abort_install

	Remove the line:

	        /etc/conf/drvmap.d/$PKGINST

	Remove the line:

		do_extract

	Remove the all the lines mentioned below:

# If this package is being added as an add-on package (not being installed
# from the initial system installation via loadhba), then for non-ISA cards
# which have boardids run 'dcu -s'.
if [ "$ROOT" != "/mnt" ]
then
	...	<- delete all the lines between and including the then and fi.
fi

	Edit the following line:
	From:

	removef ${PKGINST} /tmp /tmp/${PKGINST} /tmp/${PKGINST}/Drvmap \

	To:

	removef ${PKGINST} /tmp /tmp/${PKGINST} \

	2) Add the following line at the end of the
	   ictha.hbafloppy/ictha/prototype file, left justified:

	f none  /tmp/ictha/Driver.o 0644 root sys
