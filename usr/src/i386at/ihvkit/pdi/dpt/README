#ident	"@(#)ihvkit:pdi/dpt/README	1.7.3.1"

This directory contains all of the files necessary to do a native build
and installation of a driver for the DPT SCSI Host Adapter.  Observe the 
following precautions before building and installing the driver:

1) Read the commented section of hba.h and if necessary initialize sdi.h to 
contain the correct definition of the variable PDI_VERSION:

   The value of PDI_VERSION is:

      1   SVR4.2/UnixWare 1.1 Driver
      2   SVR4.2 DTMT (Maintainence Release) Driver
      3   SVR4.2MP Driver
      4   UnixWare 2.0 Driver
      5   UnixWare 2.1 and later Driver

   For example:

      #define PDI_VERSION	4  for UNIXWARE 2.0 driver

2) Read Notes 1,2 and 3 provided in this file.

3) Save a copy of the old dpt.h (i.e., /usr/include/sys/dpt.h).

4) Make sure that the hardware is configured for the various system parameter
values: IRQ, I/O address, etc. as provided in dpt.cf/System.  Finally
ensure that the System file (dpt.cf/System) has the the second field
set to a Y instead of a N.  This is necessary to build and configure
the driver into the kernel during a idbuild.

5)  To get a complete top down compile, link and install of the driver execute
make with the following options:

	make -f dpt.mk clean install

If you want the dpt driver package to be transfered to an HBA floppy along
with a loadable image of the driver (for load on install), execute the
makefile with the following option:

	make -f dpt.mk hbafloppy

Note:  Ensure that both the packaging tools and ksh are currently
available on the system before trying to generate the HBA floppy.
Also make sure you that you have a 3 1/2 inch diskette in your floppy
drive before executing this command.

The packaging tools are available as a part of the "usoftint" package
and the ksh is available along with the "advanced commands" package.

Verify the presence of the packaging tools by executing:

	pkginfo -l usoftint

Verify the presence of the advanced commands by executing:

	pkginfo -l cmds

NOTES

2. The make will fail if the dpt controller on your machine controls the boot
device.  Under such conditions, the dpt driver on your machine will be
configured as a static driver.  In contrast, the dpt driver built by this
sample source is a loadable driver.  To avoid complications, you
should make the Driver.o (i.e., dpt.cf/Driver.o) and manually install the
driver. Use the script:

	# # As root...
	# make -f dpt.mk headinstall dpt.cf/Driver.o
	# cp dpt.cf/Space.c /etc/conf/pack.d/dpt/space.c
	# cp dpt.cf/Driver.o /etc/conf/pack.d/dpt/Driver.o
	# idbuild -B && init 6

Note:  Do not configure your dpt driver as a loadable driver as long as the
boot device is accessed through the controller.

3. For a better understanding of the layout and use of the HBA floppies,
refer to the READMEs located under:

	/usr/src/hdk/sdi/hba/ihvhba.bldscript 

The directory dpt.hbafloppy contains the following files:

bldscript:  Used to package the driver and build an HBA floppy.

dpt/copyright:  Copyright file for the driver package.

dpt/pkginfo:  Information about the dpt driver package.
	
dpt/postinstall:  Postinstall script used during driver package installation.

dpt/preremove:  Preremove script used during driver package removal.

dpt/prototype:  Listing of all the components that make up the dpt driver
		package.

etc/HBAINST:  A script used during the second phase of the installation using
	      the HBA floppy.

The makefile option that creates the HBA floppy, copies the necessary driver
component files Driver.o, dpt.h, dpt (loadable image), Space.c, System,
Master, Drvmap, loadmods to the necessary sub-directories under
dpt.hbafloppy/dpt/tmp/dpt.  In addition, it invokes the "bldscript" to format
the floppy, make the file system, build the driver packages and eventually
transfer the package to the media.
