#ident	"@(#)ihvkit:pdi/mitsumi/README	1.6.2.2"

This directory contains all of the files necessary to build and install a
non-SCSI CD-ROM driver.  Observe the following precautions before building
and installing the driver:

1) Read the commented section of hba.h and initialize sdi.h to the appropriate
   value:

	#define PDI_VERSION	1  for UNIXWARE 1.1

   On a UnixWare 2.x system, the hba.h already contains the correct
   value (#define PDI_VERSION 4).

2) Make sure that the hardware is configured for the various system parameter
   values: IRQ, I/O, RAM address, and so on, as provided in mitsumi.cf/System.

3) This directory contains a separate set of configuration files to
   be used when compiling this driver on a 1.1 platform.  Save the 
   configuration files under mitsumi.cf (2.0 version of config files) and 
   replace them with the 1.1 versions available under uw_1.1.cf.  After the
   replacement has been done, move the hba.h file to the ictha source
   directory.


4) To get a complete top down compile, line and install of the driver execute
   make with the following options:

	make -f mitsumi.mk clean install

   If you want the mitsumi driver package to be transfered to an HBA 
   floppy along with a loadable image of the driver (for load on
   install), execute the makefile with the following option:

	make -f mitsumi.mk hbafloppy

NOTE:  Ensure that both the packaging tools and ksh are currently
available on the system before trying to generate the HBA floppy.
Also make sure you that you have a 3 1/2 inch diskette in your floppy
drive before executing this command.

The packaging tools are available as a part of the "softint" package
and the ksh is available along with the "advanced commands" package.

Verify the presence of the packaging tools by executing:

		pkginfo -l softint

Verify the presence of the advanced commands by executing:

		pkginfo -l cmds

Notes
_____

For a better understanding of the layout and use of the HBA floppies,
refer to the READMEs located under:

	/usr/src/ihvkit/pdi/ihvhba/ihvhba.bldscript 

The directory mitsumi.hbafloppy contains the following files:

bldscript:  Used to package the driver and build an HBA floppy.

mitsumi/copyright:  Copyright file for the driver package.

mitsumi/pkginfo:  Information about the mitsumi driver package.

mitsumi/postinstall:  Postinstall script used during driver package
		      installation.

mitsumi/preremove:  Preremove script used during driver package removal.

mitsumi/prototype:  Listing of all the components that make up the
		    mitsumi driver package.

etc/HBAINST:  A script used during the second phase of the installation
	      using the HBA floppy.


The makefile creates the HBA floppy, copies the necessary driver
component files Driver.o, mitsumi.h, mitsumi (loadable image), Space.c,
System, Master, Drvmap, loadmods to the necessary sub-directories under
mitsumi.hbafloppy/mitsumi/tmp/mitsumi.  In addition, it invokes the
"bldscript" to format the floppy, make the file system, build the driver
packages and eventually transfer the package to the media.


NOTE: When building the 1.1 version of the HBA floppy modify the
makefile to remove the Drvmap file from the list of installable objects
(Makefile variable OBJECTS), as well as in the prototype file located in
mitsumi.hbafloppy/mitsumi.  The Drvmap files are needed for
autoconfig-ready 2.0 drivers.  In addition, the "bldscript" must be
modified, so that the '-c' option is added to the two lines where the
pkgmk command could be run.

Note2:  Because the idtools for UnixWare 1.1 do not contain the functionality
to generate a viable Driver.o from the loadable module, and the Drvmap file
does not exist for this release, several additional modifications must be
made to the installation and build scripts.

	1) Add 'Driver.o' to the list of OBJECTS in the Makefile.

	2) Within the mitsumi.hbafloppy/mitsumi/postinstall script, make
	   the changes:

	Remove the 4 consecutive lines:

                        if [ -f $SVDIR/drvmap.d/$PKGINST ]
                        then
                                cp $SVDIR/drvmap.d/$PKGINST /etc/conf/drvmap.d
                        fi

	Remove the 7 consecutive lines:

                if [ ! -d $SVDIR/drvmap.d ]
                then
                        mkdir $SVDIR/drvmap.d 2>&1 >/dev/null
                fi
                mv /etc/conf/drvmap.d/$PKGINST $SVDIR/drvmap.d
                mv /tmp/$PKGINST/Drvmap /etc/conf/drvmap.d/$PKGINST
                [ $? -ne 0 ] && abort_install

	Remove the line:

	        /etc/conf/drvmap.d/$PKGINST

	Remove the line:

		do_extract

	Remove the all the lines mentioned below:

# If this package is being added as an add-on package (not being installed
# from the initial system installation via loadhba), then for non-ISA cards
# which have boardids run 'dcu -s'.
if [ "$ROOT" != "/mnt" ]
then
	...	<- delete all the lines between and including the then and fi.
fi

	Edit the following line:
	From:

	removef ${PKGINST} /tmp /tmp/${PKGINST} /tmp/${PKGINST}/Drvmap \

	To:

	removef ${PKGINST} /tmp /tmp/${PKGINST} \

	2) Add the following line at the end of the
	   mitsumi.hbafloppy/mitsumi/prototype file, left justified:

	f none  /tmp/mitsumi/Driver.o 0644 root sys
