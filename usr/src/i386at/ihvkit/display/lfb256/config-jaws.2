# Notes
#
# The memory size is ignored.  Setting it to 0 might upset the server.
# 
# The virtual size should be set the same as the display size.  It is
# ignored in any case.
# 
# fb_depth of 8 has been tested.  fb_depth of 12 and 16 are not
# available at the current time.
# 
# visual should be set to PseudoColor for 8bpp.  It should be set to
# TrueColor for other depths.
#
