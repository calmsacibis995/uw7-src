To generate a Makefile, use the command:

	/usr/X/bin/imake -DTOPDIR=. -DCURDIR=. -I/usr/X/lib/config

This will use the header files and libraries provided with this package.

Do not use -DUseInstalled, as indicated in Imakefile, since that will try
to use the existing headers and libraries, which might not work if you
have an older version of the X server.  When you are ready to perform a
make you must set the variable DISPLIBREV (for example, "make DISPLIBREV=1").
