# Notes
#
# The memory size is ignored.  Setting it to 0 might upset the server.
# 
# The virtual size should be set the same as the display size.  It is
# ignored in any case.
# 
# fb_depth of 8 has been tested.  fb_depth of 16, 24, and 32 are not
# available at the current time.
# 
# visual should be set to PseudoColor for 8bpp.  It should be set to
# TrueColor for other depths.
# 
# In 24bpp, info2vendorlib should be set to either "RGB" or "BGR" to
# determine pixel order.  For 32bpp, set it to either "RGBa" or
# "aBGR".
# 
# The following resolutions are available:
# 
# 	640x480		60 Hz

# Frequencies marked with a * are interlaced.
# 
# The resolution is not dependent on the depth, although not all
# models support all combinations of resolution, depth, and pixel
# order.  If the X server fails because it is not supported, an error
# message will indicate so.
