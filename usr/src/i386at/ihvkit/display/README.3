Following are the instructions for creating/installing the Video Device
Driver and Display Modules provided in the IHV Kit.  The instructions
for the ATI samples are the same as for the JAWS samples:


ATI

First, the associated kernel driver must be created and installed:

     # cd /usr/src/ihvkit/display/lfb256/FB/ati
     # make
     # cd bin

     The following line should be executed only if the driver already
     exists:

     # /etc/conf/bin/idinstall -d ati

     Now, perform the actual install of the driver, and create the loadable
     module:

     # /etc/conf/bin/idinstall -ak ati
     # /etc/conf/bin/idbuild -M ati

     At this point, the driver is active.  Without rebooting or
     rebuilding the kernel, test it by typing:

     # < /dev/ati

     If successful, the above command line will display the physical
     address of the ATI frame buffer.  If it fails, you will see an
     error message indicating what was wrong.


Next, the Chipset-specific Display Module library (LFB) must be created:

     # cd /usr/src/ihvkit/display/lfb256
     # /usr/X/bin/imake -DTOPDIR=. -DCURDIR=. -I/usr/X/lib/config

     During the next step, ignore the displayed makefile failure report
     about not knowing how to make 'all'.

     # make DISPLIBREV=2


Now, create the vendor-specific Display Module library (ATI):

     # cd devices/ati
     # /usr/X/bin/imake -DTOPDIR=. -DCURDIR=. -I/usr/X/lib/config
     # make DISPLIBREV=2


Finally, install the library and configuration files in the appropriate
places:

     # cp libati.so.2 /usr/X/lib/display
     # cd ../..
     # cp liblfb.so.2 /usr/X/lib/display
     # mv /usr/X/defaults/Xwinconfig /usr/X/defaults/OXwinconfig
     # cp config-ati.2 /usr/X/defaults/Xwinconfig


At this point, to use the new Display Modules, just start or restart xdm.



GD54XX

To create the chip-specific GD54XX Display module library, with its
associated Super-VGA library (vga256), follow the instruction located in
/usr/src/ihvkit/display/vga256/devices/gd54xx/README.
