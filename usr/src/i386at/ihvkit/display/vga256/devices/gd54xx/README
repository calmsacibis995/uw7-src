#ident	"@(#)ihvkit:display/vga256/devices/gd54xx/README	1.2"

This driver is provided as a reference source on using the existing
"libvga256.so.2", if you have a similar hardware.

For example, if you have a new 'XYZ' video card, which is super-VGA
compatible card which has only 'screen to screen' hardware support:

To write a driver for this hardware to support X in a UnixWare
environment, you need to write the following 5 functions:

	- DM_Initialize		; entry point called by the X server
	- init_xyz		; initialize a required mode
	- restore_xyz		; restore to the previous mode
	- selectpage_xyz	; select the 64K segmented page
	- ScreenToScreen 	; hardware screen-to-screen support function

"DM_Initialize" is the entry point for any video driver. This is the
only function known (directly) to the "X server".  All other functions
in the video driver are accessed indirectly through the "SIFunctions"
data structure.

When "DM_Initialize" returns, all function pointers are initialized.

"init_xyz" is called at startup time and also every time when X is
vt-switched back.

"restore_xyz" is called while exiting from X or switching to another
vt (or console)

"ScreenToScreen" is called for any screen to screen operations.


+---------------------------+
| Step by Step Instructions |
+---------------------------+

1. Execute the command:

	mkdir ../xyz #(i.e., /usr/src/ihvkit/display/vga256/devices/xyz)

2. Execute the commands:

	cd /usr/src/ihvkit/display/vga256/devices/gd54xx
	cp * ../xyz
	cd ../xyz

3. Edit Imakefile and Makefile:

	- Change the references from 'gd54xx' to 'xyz'.

4. Edit init.c file:

	- Replace the body of gd54xx_selectpage to handle 'xyz' selectpage.
	- Replace the body of gd54xx_init function with appropriate mode
	  initializing code.
	- Replace the body of gd54xx_restore function to restore
	  the saved modes.

5. Make and install the library, by running the commands:

	make
        cp xyz_256.so.2 /usr/X/lib/display

6. Preparing to test a mode:

	- Execute the command:

		mv gd54xx.256dat xyz.256dat

	- Edit xyz.256dat to make sure the data corresponds to the supported
          modes (See init.c for data).

	- Execute the command:

		mv gd54xx.cfg xyz.cfg

	- Edit xyz.cfg to change all occurrences of the string "gd54xx"
		to "xyz" and make sure the data corresponds to the
		supported modes.

	- Execute the command:

		mv gd54xx.vinfo xyz.vinfo

	- Edit xyz.vinfo and change all occurrences of the string "gd54xx"
          to "xyz".

	- Execute the commands:

		cp xyz.cfg xyz.vinfo xyz.256dat /usr/X/lib/display
		cd /usr/X/lib/display

        - Log in as root from the console, with the graphical login
          disabled.

7. To test a mode:

NOTE:  For the following instructions to apply, the resident
operating system should be UnixWare 2.x or UnixWare 1.1.1
(that is, Update 5).

- If the resident OS is UnixWare 1.1.1, execute the commands:

	cd /usr/X/lib/display
	./setvgamode -vinfo xyz.vinfo

- If the resident OS is UnixWare 2.0 or later, execute the
  commands:

	cd /usr/X/lib/display
	./setvideomode -vinfo xyz.vinfo

- Another possibility for testing the mode is to execute the
  commands:

	cd /usr/X/lib/display
	X -config xyz.cfg &

NOTE:  At this point, except for initializing modes, everything
is handled by libvga256.so.2 in software. 

8. Now, add hardware functions:

- Replace the body of the "gd54xx_ss_bitblt" routine with the
  appropriate code to handle 'xyz' screen-to-screen operations.

- In "xyz_init" function, make sure the following line is uncommented:

	/* pfuncs->si_ss_bitblt = gd54xx_ss_bitblt */

- All the possible hardware functions are left in this pkg for
  reference but these functions are not mapped.

9. How to make 'setvideomode' recognize the new driver:

The 'setvideomode' utility reads the information about the supported
vendors from "/usr/X/lib/display/VendorInfo" file.  You can also
specify a different "vendor info" file by using the "-vinfo" option.
For example:

	setvideomode -vinfo gd54xx.vinfo


The file, "gd54xx.vinfo" (or VendorInfo) is a plain ASCII text file.
Please study the different fields carefully. The mode data file is
"gd54xx.256dat". You can modify the fields, but make sure the 
appropriate files are present in "/usr/X/lib/display" directory.

For example, to create a new vendor info and mode data files for the
new "xyz" driver:

	cp gd54xx.vinfo xyz.vinfo

Now, edit "xyz.vinfo" and change the descriptions and other fields
accordingly:

	VENDOR_LIB = xyz.so.1
	CONFIGFILE = xyz.dat
	...

	DESCRIPTION = "XYZ from ABC Inc"
	...

Make sure "xyz.so.1" and "xyz.dat" are present in the
"/usr/X/lib/display/" directory.
