This README file contains some of the information
about the ndsample package.

It is loosly organized as follows:
- Building the sample MDI drivers 
- Packaging your drivers

This file is not intended to replace the online documentation or online
examples.


Building the sample MDI drivers:
--------------------------------

To build the sample MDI drivers that are found under /usr/src/hdk/net/mdi,
you must add "UTSRULES=/usr/src/hdk/net/mdi/uts.rulefile" to your
environment, or run something like the following:

	make -f e3D.mk UTSRULES=/usr/src/hdk/net/mdi/uts.rulefile


Packaging your drivers:
-----------------------

We have provided a simple framework to assist with packaging your
drivers.  To make use of this, you may place your driver source
under a directory called "/usr/src/hdk/net/mdi/<driver_prefix>",
where <driver_prefix> is replaced with your driver prefix.  Your makefile
must be called "/usr/src/hdk/net/mdi/<driver_prefix>/<driver_prefix>.mk",
and the result of building the all target is a idinstallable DSP under the
"/usr/src/hdk/net/mdi/<driver_prefix>/<driver_prefix>.cf" directory.
If you wish to build your driver(s) somewhere besides /usr/src/hdk/net/mdi,
you may use the mdi.mk makefile and change the NETDIR macro.
Please see the section of this README entitled "Packaging your driver for
submitting to SCO" for more details.

The mdi.mk file will automatically generate a pkgaddable image for you when the
"pkg" target is built:
	
	# cd /usr/src/hdk/net/mdi
	# UTSRULES=`pwd`/uts.rulefile make -f mdi.mk pkg
	# pkgtrans -s /usr/src/hdk/net/pkg /tmp/newnics.pkg
