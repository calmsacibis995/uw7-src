This directory contains unsupported contrib software.

	demo - is the standard TET1.10 demo, with an additional
	       scenario etet_scen to demo some of the ETET extensions

	suite - is a test suite for the ETET, which tests both TET
	        base functionality for Perl, Shell and C API's as
		well as ETET extensions.

		This suite runs the suites under the contrib/api and
		contrib/napi directories.

	cplusdemo - a simple C++ demo. This is the standard TET1.10 demo
		written in C++ with minor extensions to demonstrate the
		tet_exec() call in the C++ API.

	usltools - a sample buildtool and awk script to generate summary
		results.

	port - a TET portability library for  BSD systems (taken from the
		MIT X test suite release 1.2).  The portability library 
		may be useful as a base for porting the TET to
		other non-POSIX systems, however the portability library 
		is designed to run on a BSD system, and will not 
		necessarily build without change on other systems.

	SHELL-API - this is the XPG3 Shell API demo suite from the 
		TET Programmers Guide. See the README file
		for instructions on how to execute this.


To run the test suites provided here, please check for any README
files. Also note that unless you specify that the test suites
are rooted here in the contrib directory you'll need to specify
the path from TET_ROOT on the command invocation to tcc,

for example to run the demo suite

	TET_ROOT=tet_root
	export TET_ROOT
	tcc -p -bec contrib/demo

or 
	TET_SUITE_ROOT=$TET_ROOT/contrib
	export TET_SUITE_ROOT
	tcc -p -bec demo
