The following is an extract from the Xtest User Guide:

The portability library may be useful as a base for porting the TET to
other non-POSIX systems, however the portability library is designed to
run on a BSD system, and will not necessarily build without change
on other systems.

The following routines are emulated for use under a BSD system, and these
may be needed on other systems:

	getcwd() getopt() putenv() sigaction()
	sigaddset() sigdelset() sigemptyset() sigfillset()
	sigismember() sigpending() sigprocmask() sigsuspend()
	strchr() strcspn() strftime() strpbrk() strrchr()
	strspn() strtok() toupper() upcase() vsprintf() waitpid()

Only the features that are used by the X test suite are emulated. They
are not meant to mimic completely the standard behaviour.

There is also an include directory port/INC that contains
header files that are required and are not found on a BSD system.

To adapt the portability library to other systems, the following
hints may be useful:

- Examine the directory port/INC. If the system provides a standard
  conforming header of the same name as one in the INC directory, the
  remove the version from the INC directory.

- The header files contain the bare minimum information required to
support the TET and use BSD features. It may be necessary to alter
them to suit the local system. This applies particularly to signal.h.

- It may be necessary to add other header files.

- In the library Makefile remove any function that is already provided
  by the system in a standard conforming form.

- Examine the code of the remaining functions to make sure that they will
  work on the target system.
