#To install the test suite:
	PATH=$PATH:$TET_ROOT/contrib/SHELL-API/bin
	export PATH
	./bin/install

	tcc -p -b -a `pwd`/ts_exec contrib/SHELL-API
	tcc -p -e -a `pwd`/ts_exec contrib/SHELL-API

If you decide to run these shell bindings with the ksh API
you must edit the shell files and change the first line (:)
to /usr/bin/ksh else it forces selection of a sh shell.
