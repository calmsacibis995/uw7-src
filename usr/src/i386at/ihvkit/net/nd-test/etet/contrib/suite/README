Test Suite for ETET, See ETET Test Plan Version 0.5 (tet_root/doc/testplan)

To run this;  sh runtest

This test suite utilizes the tet_root/contrib/api and tet_root/contrib/napi
test suites.

The default location for perl is assumed to be /bin/perl.
If you perl is not located there, or is not symlinked, the run
review the script fixperl and run it
	sh fixperl

(the default for fixperl is to change the path to /usr/local/gnu/perl
 from /bin/perl)
	
To run this suite, ensure the following
(note a script runtest is also provided to do this for you)


	TET_ROOT  and TET_TMP_DIR are set correctly and exported

	TET_ROOT=/home/etet  
	TET_TMP_DIR=/tmp
	TET_EXTENDED=true
	export TET_ROOT TET_TMP_DIR TET_EXTENDED

	PATH includes $TET_ROOT/bin and the current directory, so tcc and
	the api suite buildtools can be found.

	PATH=$PATH:$TET_ROOT/bin:.
	export PATH

Then type
	tcc -e -p contrib/suite


KNOWN PROBLEMS:


This test suite is still under revision
and some changes  for increased portability are expected to be made.

There have been a couple of problems observed:

(i) One observed problem occurs with the type of shell used for 
the test contrib/api/src/stest1. If /bin/sh is used then on many
implementations the ETET (e*) API tests will fail due to corrupted
writes to journal files. The problem is as follows:

Common implementations of "sh" are not POSIX compliant
in append mode writes. Hence if ">>" is used in a shell script
to write to a file, the "sh" utility will open the file in WRITE mode
and seek to EOF before it writes any output, whcih can create
timing windows that allow journal file corruption. The Korn shell
does not have this problem since it opens the file in O_APPEND mode, 
which does an internal seek to EOF before each write allowing no other 
system activity  between the seek and the write.



If you want to test the ksh API, see the release notes for how
to replace the XPG3 Shell API with the Korn Shell API.
