SCCS:   	@(#)tcmchild.c	1.10 06/23/92
NAME:		'C' API executed process main function
PRODUCT:	TET (Test Environment Toolkit)
AUTHOR:		Geoff Clare, UniSoft Ltd.
DATE CREATED:	31 July 1990
SYNOPSIS:

	extern int tet_main(int argc, char *argv[]);

	int main(int argc, char **argv);
	int tet_thistest;

DESCRIPTION:

	The main() routine provided here is for use in processes
	executed by tet_exec().  The user-supplied tet_main() function
	is called with the arguments passed to tet_exec().  Configuration
	variables are read in from the file specified in the environment
	by TET_CONFIG.  The variable tet_thistest is set to its value in
	the calling process.  The current context is preserved from the
	calling process, the block number is incremented and sequence
	number reset to 1.

MODIFICATIONS:

	Geoff Clare, UniSoft Ltd., 6 Sept 1990
		Pass tet_activity on command line.
		Add tet_cleanup definition.
		Move tet_error() to resfile.c.
	
	Geoff Clare, UniSoft Ltd., 10 Oct 1990
		Rename file and change sccsid.

	Andrew Josey, UNIX System Labs, Inc. May 1993
		Change main() to tcm_childmain() for C++ building
		as part of ETET revision
