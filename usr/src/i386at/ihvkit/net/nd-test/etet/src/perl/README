If the location of the perl utility is in a location other
than /usr/bin, then edit the fixperl script and run that
prior to the make.

For the exact usage of each call/variable,
consult the TET Programmers's Guide.

Perl Calling conventions:

	&tet'setcontext;
	
	&tet'setblock;
	
	&tet'infoline("<info>");
	
	&tet'result("<RESULT>");
	
		Default code list =  PASS,  FAIL, UNRESOLVED, NOTINUSE,
			UNSUPPORTED, UNTESTED, UNINITIATED, NORESULT
	
	&tet'delete("<test name>", ["reason"]);
	
	&tet'reason("<test name>");
	

Variable references:


	@iclist=(ic1,ic2...icn);
	
	@ic1=(my_tp1);
	@ic2=(my_tp2,my_tp3);
	
	$tet'startup="my_startup_routine";
	$tet'cleanup="my_cleanup_routine";
	
	@tet'sig_leave_list=(...);
	@tet'sig_ignore_list=(...);

	$tet'thistest;



API compliant program structure:

	set iclist, ic's, optional setup/cleanup routines

	code for subroutines

	"require "$ENV{\"TET_ROOT\"}/lib/perl/tcm.pl";"
	

	

Notes:

	User test purposes, startup and cleanup routines must be in the
		"main" namespace.

	$[ (array base) must not be changed (currently at default of 0).


	A user calling 'exit' in any user routines will exit with no
		post processing.  Perl does not allow exit-cleanup routines.
