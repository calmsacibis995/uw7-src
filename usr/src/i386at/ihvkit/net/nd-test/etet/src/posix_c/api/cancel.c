SCCS:   	@(#)cancel.c	1.10 06/23/92
NAME:		'C' API test purpose cancel functions
PRODUCT:	TET (Test Environment Toolkit)
AUTHOR:		Geoff Clare, UniSoft Ltd.
DATE CREATED:	26 July 1990
SYNOPSIS:

	void tet_delete(int test_no, char *reason);
	char *tet_reason(int test_no);
	void tet_delreas(int numtests);

DESCRIPTION:

	Tet_delete() marks the test purpose given by test_no as
	cancelled with the specified reason.  This causes the TCM
	to output an UNINITIATED result for that test purpose, and
	the corresponding function in tet_testlist[] is not called.
	The reason argument must point to static data as tet_delete()
	does not copy it internally, and the function calling
	tet_delete() will have returned before the reason string
	is examined by the TCM.

	If test_no has been cancelled tet_reason() returns the reason
	for cancellation, otherwise it returns NULL.

	Note that test purposes are numbered in the sequence of the
	tet_testlist[] array (starting at 1) regardless of execution
	sequence.

	Tet_delreas() is not part of the API.  It is called by the
	TCM to set up data for use by tet_delete() and tet_reason().

MODIFICATIONS:

	Geoff Clare, UniSoft Ltd, 6 Sept 1991
		Add tet_delreas() function.
		Change fixed MAX_TESTS to dynamic numtests.

	SunSoft ETET Extension
		Add support for SunOS41.

	ETET1.10.1 review
		Remove SunOS41 inclusion, now handled by defines
		in the Makefile.
