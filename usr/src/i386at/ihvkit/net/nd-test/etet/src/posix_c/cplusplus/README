C++ bindings

Two additional libraries are added to TET_ROOT/lib/posix_c
These libraries provide a C++ main plus a call from there to
the C main for test cases, and test cases launched with tet_exec().

	libCtcm.a  equivalent to tcm.o
	libCtcmc.a equivalent to tcmchild.o

C++ progs should link to libCtcm.a before TET_ROOT/lib/libapi.a

C++ progs to be launched by tet_exec() should be linked to
libCtcmc.a.


A sample demo suite is provided in contrib/cplusdemo. This gives
an example of the linkage between the C and C++ parts of the ETET.
