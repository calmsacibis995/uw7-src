Top level makefile:
 
Before running the toplevel makefile, you should edit the following subsidiary
makefiles:
		tet_root/src/posix_c/makefile
		tet_root/src/xpg3sh/api/makefile
		tet_root/src/ksh/api/makefile
		tet_root/src/perl/makefile

Please refer to the release notes for details of how to configure
the makefiles.

What's to change in the top-level makefile?

The only parameter passed down to the other makefiles is that of
the TET_ROOT directory which will be compiled in as a default (note
that this can be overidden in the environment at runtime).

By default the "all" target includes

     TET POSIX C API
     TET XPG3 Shell API
     TET Korn Shell API
     TET Perl API

To not build one of these targets just remove them from the all: line.
To add the TET C++ binding to the default build add the target cplusplus
to the following line.
