ETET ksh API binding

This is the ksh binding donated by HP to the TET Workshop in tetworks 318
which has been modified for use with ETET.  These are 
between 3 and 5 times faster than the original shell bindings.

It's possible to slot the ksh bindings in as a replacement for the
xpg3sh bindings in two ways:

Either (1) install in lib/ksh and then create symlinks in lib/xpg3sh
	
	cd $TET_ROOT/lib/xpg3sh
	ln -s ../ksh/tcm.ksh tcm.sh
	ln -s ../ksh/tetapi.ksh tetapi.sh

or (2) replace the xpg3sh bindings with the ksh bindings
	cp $TET_ROOT/lib/ksh/tcm.ksh $TET_ROOT/lib/xpg3sh/tcm.sh
	cp $TET_ROOT/lib/ksh/tetapi.ksh $TET_ROOT/lib/xpg3sh/tetapi.sh

Alternately they can be used directly by placing the following line
at the bottom of Korn Shell test scripts.

	.	$TET_ROOT/lib/ksh/ksh.tcm

Some sample makefiles are provided in the mkfiles directory
