How to compile 
--------------

Make sure that the TET_ROOT environment variable is set to the ETET directory
and SUITE_ROOT environment variables is set to the home directory of the tests.

Make the changes in the library/source files in the corresponding directories.
Then execute the following commands from this directory :

			. ./env.sh
			make clean
			make all

This will compile and link all the binaries. This is done using TeT. 
The results will be placed in journal files in the directory "results".
Once this is done sucessfully , the binaries are available in the bin directory.

How to package
--------------

Make sure that environment variable TEMP is set to the directory where the
packages should be built. Most common directory used for package is 
/var/spool/pkg.

Run the following command from $SUITE_ROOT/pkg/nd-drvr directory:

	./nd-drvr.pkg
