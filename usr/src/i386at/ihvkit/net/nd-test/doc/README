Gemini ND Certification Suites Version 4.2

HOW TO INSTALL THE TESTS
========================

The test suites can be installed from the media using 'pkgadd' command.
You must be logged in as 'root' in order to install the test suite packages.

The following steps can be used to install the test suite package:

	Log in as root.

	Use the tar command to copy the test file 'nd-test' from the 2 set 
        floppy to the  /tmp directory.

               # cd /tmp
               # tar xv

	Then use the following command:

		# pkgadd -d /tmp/nd-test

	Press <Enter> to select the package to be installed.

	Press <Enter> to select the default (/home/ndcert) home directory
	for the tests.

	Press <Enter> at the password prompt to select no password (Actually
	<Enter> as password).

	The installation process will add 'ndcert' as a user with no password
	and '/home/ndcert' as home directory.

Refer to USER_GUIDE for details on 'HOW TO RUN THE TESTS'. There are two 
versions of the User Guide. The USER_GUIDE is a Microsoft Word docunent and 
the USER_GUIDE_TXT is a text version of the guide for those unable to access
the MS word document. 


IMPORTANT NOTES:
The test suites are divided into 2 types depending on what state the
machines need to be in. The first set of 6 tests(nd-mdi nd-dlpmdi 
nd-isdn nd-drvr nd-ncard and nd-util) need to be in init state 1 and 
the tests are executed by running the test SIMULTANEOUSLY on both the 
test and remote machine. The rest of the tests (nd-dlpi nd-spx nd-tcp
and nd-nfs) need to be in init state 3(the default state) and ONLY the
TEST machine test is executed to perform the test.
