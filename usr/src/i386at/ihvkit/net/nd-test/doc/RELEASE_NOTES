                             Release Notes

                          (Dated 25th December '96)





This document describes solution to various problems encountered while 
running the UnixWare ND Certification Suites. 

The commands which follow # should be run as superuser and those which
follow $ should be run as 'ndcert' user.

The following applies to all the tests and must be checked in case the test
could not be started or if the test aborts without completion:

	1. Make sure the two machine can talk to each other. Use the following
           command:

		# ping <machine name>

	   Run the above command from both the machines.

	2. Use the following command to make sure that the machine under test
           can run remote commands on the remote machine:

		$ rsh <remote_machine> ls

	   If this command fails, include the name of the local machine (the 
           system under test) in /etc/hosts.equiv file of the remote machine.

	3. Check for the multiple processes running due to abnormal termination
           of the tests. e.g.

		$ ps -ef |grep ndcert

	    Kill all the test processes which may be running using:

		$ kill -9 <process id>

	4. Remove any lock file (/home/ndcert/nd-tcp/bin/tet_lck) on both
           the machines using:

		$ rm /home/ndcert/<test_suite_name>/bin/tet_lck

	   where <test_suite_name> is the name of the test (e.g. nd-dlpi).
	
	5. Make sure there is enough hard disk space on both the machines
           as most of the tests involve copying files across the network. 
	   Atleast 42.3MB of hard disk space is required to run all the tests
	   successfully.
       
Data Link Provider Interface (DLPI) tests
-----------------------------------------

PROBLEM:  The tests report many UNRESOLVED results.

SOLUTION: Check the result file and find out the actual cause of the 
          problem.  The result file is encripted and can be found in 
          /home/ndcert/nd-dlpi/result. This file can be displayed 
          using 'unc_read' utility provided with the tests. To display 
          the result file:

		$ unc_read <result_file> |more

          Look at the very first UNRESOLVED test and the reason why the
          test cannot be resolved. For example, if the reason is:

		device not found

	  Check the file /home/ndcert/nd-dlpi/dlpi_config. This file should 
          have contained the device names, machine names and MAC addresses of
          both the machine involved in testing. Do not change this file as
          this file is created automatically during the test. Look for a 
          problem on the machine for which the entry is not found in this 
          file.
          
          Check the ND configuration in file /etc/confnet.d/inet/interface
          make sure that there are no entries for the devices which are not
          configured in the system. 

          Check if the interfaces are correctly configured and up and running.
          This can be done using:

		# ifconfig -a

SPX stress test
---------------

PROBLEM:  The test could not be started or comes out immediately.

SOLUTION: Make sure the two machines can talk to each other over SPX. Use the 
          following command:

		# nwsapinfo -d 

	  Make sure that the names of both the machines appear in the output.
	  If this is not the case, the two machines are either not running
          the same frame type or the two machines cannot talk to each other.
          Use the 'nwcm' command to check the frame type on both the machines
          and correct the frame type if they don't match.

NFS stress test
---------------
PROBLEM:  The test could not be started.

SOLUTION: Make sure that the file system is shared on the remote machine in 
          order to be able to be mounted on the system under test. Use the
	  following command:

		# share <file_system_name>

NUCFS stress test
-----------------

PROBLEM:  The test could not be started or comes out immediately.

SOLUTION: Make sure that the system under test can see the netware server. Use
          the following command:

		# nwsapinfo -d 

	  The name of the netware server should appear in the output of this
          command.  If this is not the case, the two machines (the system
          under test and the netware server) are either not running the same 
          frame type or the two machines are not connected to each other.
          Use the 'nwcm' command to check the frame type on the UnixWare
	  machine and correct the frame type to that of the netware server.

	  Use the 'nwlogin' command being superuser on the UnixWare machine
          to login into the netware server as NW_LOGIN user and verify that 
          a file can be written and read from the netware server in directory
          /.NetWare/NW_SERVER/NW_VOLUME/<machine_name>. Where NW_LOGIN,
          NW_SERVER, NW_VOLUME are the values specified as configuration 
          parameters and <machine_name> is the name of the system under test.
