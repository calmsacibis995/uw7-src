This is a sample Ethernet driver for use with UnixWare 1.1.  The driver
can be generated and installed by executing the top-level make file.

	make -f dlpi_ether.mk install

Before the driver source files can be compiled and installed however:

1) Save (make backup copies of) the following files:

	/usr/include/sys/dlpi_ether.h
	/usr/include/sys/dlpi_el16.h
	/usr/include/sys/el16.h
	/etc/conf/pack.d/el16/Driver.o
	/etc/conf/pack.d/el16/space.c
	/etc/conf/sdevice.d/el16
	/etc/conf/mdevice.d/el16
	/etc/conf/node.d/el16

2) Replace the contents of the System file (located in ./el16.cf)
   by the contents of /etc/conf/sdevice.d/el16 to reflect the correct
   choice of IRQ, RAM address, and so on.

3) Ensure that the cable type settings on your adapter match the values 
   present in ./el16.cf/Space.c.

4) After the driver is installed, perform a rebuild and reboot the system.
