# AT floppy bootstrap gets loaded at 0:0x7C00
# Floppy boot needs no disk mark.
#	NOTE: Previous USL/UnixWare bootstraps did put a disk mark on the
#	floppy boot, but I (kdg) believe this was misguided, particularly
#	since some versions placed it at offset 510 and some placed it at
#	offset 506 (with an unfounded claim about BIOS reserving the last
#	4 bytes). The OSR5 floppy bootstrap has no disk mark.
