"Usage: vxdiskadd disk-address-pattern-list...

  Use this operation to add one or more disks to a disk group.  You can
  add the selected disks to an existing disk group or to a new disk group
  that will be created as a part of the operation. The selected disks may
  also be added to a disk group as hot spares. The selected disks may also
  be initialized without adding them to a disk group leaving the disks
  available for use as replacement disks.

  More than one disk or pattern may be entered at the prompt.  Here are
  some disk selection examples:

  all:		all disks
  c3 c4b0t2:	all disks on both controller 3 and controller 4, bus 0, target 2
  c3b0t4d2:	a single disk"
