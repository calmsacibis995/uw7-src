 ERROR: The Device Configuration Utility(DCU) has detected
 a hardware conflict that requires attention and therefore
 the installation cannot continue.

 TO FIX:
 You must reconfigure the conflicting hardware. This may
 require either changing hardware settings and/or execution
 of a configuration utility.

 See the UnixWare Installation Handbook for more information.
         - Appendix B, Hardware Configuration Notes
         - Appendix E, Troubleshooting

 Please take note of the conflicts that will be displayed.
