EVACUATE SUBDISKS FROM DISK HELP

This operation takes two VM disks and moves all subdisks and their
contents from one to the other.  This is useful if you need to move 
subdisks from a physical disk that you need to replace or change 
for some reason.

This is accomplished by performing multiple, sequential "sd move"
operations that move the subdisks from one disk to the other.


Fields
----------

Disk group name:
	Enter the name of the disk group that both disks belong to.  The
	name of the disk group is required.

Evacuate From:
	Enter the name of the VM disk that you want to evacuate the
	subdisks from.  This field is required.

Evacuate To:
	This is the name of the VM disk that you want to evacuate the
	subdisks to.  This field is optional.  If no disk name is
	specified in this field, the Volume Manager will choose an 
	appropriate disk for you.
