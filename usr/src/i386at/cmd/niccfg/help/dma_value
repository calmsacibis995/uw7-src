 at which your Network Card is configured.  The value shown is 
 a default only and is not necessarily correct.  To display the 
 list of choices, press <F2>. 

 If you are unsure of this value, you should shut down your  
 system now and follow the manufacturer's instructions on how 
 to configure your card.
