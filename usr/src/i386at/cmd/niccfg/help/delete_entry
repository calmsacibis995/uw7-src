.title Delete Entry Help Screen

 You may now delete one or more of the non-autodetected Network Card 
 entries to be configured.  To delete an entry, the value in the field 
 corresponding to that entry should be 'Yes'.  To preserve an entry, 
 the value should be 'No'.  To change a value for an entry, TAB the 
 cursor to that entry and press F2.

 NOTE: You cannot delete any entry that corresponds to an autodetectable 
 network card (e.g., EISA, PCI), since these are automatically detected 
 by the utility.  The only way to avoid configuring these cards is to 
 shutdown the machine, remove the network card, reboot the machine and 
 re-run this utility.
