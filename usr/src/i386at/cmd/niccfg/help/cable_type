 You must now select the Cable Type for which your network 
 card is configured.  The value shown is a default only and 
 is not necessarily correct.  To display the list of choices, 
 press <F2>. 

 If you are unsure of this value, you should shut down your 
 system now and follow the manufacturer's instructions on how 
 to configure your card.
