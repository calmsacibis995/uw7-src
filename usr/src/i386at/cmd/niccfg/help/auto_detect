.title Network Card Summary Help Screen

 This display shows the network cards that have been detected. 
 NOTE: Some cards are unable to be automatically detected and they 
 may not appear.  You must now choose one of the following options:

   ACCEPT ALL ENTRIES
        If the list of network cards is complete, select this option to 
        have the NICS utility configure the driver for each card listed. 

   ADD AN ENTRY FOR AN ISA CARD
        If the list of network cards is incomplete, select this option
        to choose from the list of non-autodetectable (e.g., ISA) cards 
        that are supported.  You must select network cards one at a time. 
 
   DELETE AN ENTRY FOR AN ISA CARD
        If there is an entry in the display that is incorrect, select 
        this option to delete it.  You cannot delete any autodetectable 
        entries, since these are automatically detected by the utility.
        The only way to avoid configuring these cards is to shutdown the 
        machine, remove the network card, reboot the machine and re-run 
        this utility.

   INSTALL DRIVER FROM IHV DISKETTE
        If the driver for the network card installed in your 
        machine is unsupported or outdated, select this option
        to install your own version from an IHV Diskette.  The
        format of this floppy must conform to the specifications
        described in the UnixWare 2.1 IHV Development Kit.

   EXIT THIS UTILITY WITHOUT MAKING CHANGES
        If you do not wish to make any changes to the system at 
        this time, select this option to exit this utility.
