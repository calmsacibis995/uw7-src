.title Configuration Check Help Screen

 The autodetection feature of UnixWare was unable to determine 
 exactly what Network Card is installed in the bus and slot 
 listed in the display on the top of the screen. It has narrowed 
 the choices down to the network cards listed in the choices box 
 at the bottom of the screen. 

 At this time you must select which network card is installed in 
 your machine.
