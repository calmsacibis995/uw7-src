In order to add new structure definitions to scodb:

1.  Generate an object module .o which #include's the structures of
    interest.  This must be compiled with the "cc -g -W0,-d1" option to 
    to generate DWARF I format debugging information.
    Ensure that you build the object with "make" flags matching the
    DEBUG/non-DEBUG UNIPROC/non-UNIPROC status of the kernel in which scodb
    is installed.  Do not use the name "kstruct.o" for this module, as this
    already exists and contains the core kernel structure definitions.

2.  Copy the new object module into the /etc/conf/pack.d/scodb/info directory.

3.  At this point, the structure definitions will be automatically added to
    to scodb.

In order to add line numbers into scodb (note that this only works
for static parts of the kernel and not dynamically loadable parts):

1.  Recompile the desired modules with the "cc -g -W0,-d1" option to 
    to generate DWARF I format line number debugging information.

2.  Re-link a new kernel with the re-compiled modules.

3.  After the new kernel is re-booted, the line number information will
    be printed out automatically when disassembling the modules which were
    re-compiled with "-g -W0,-d1".
