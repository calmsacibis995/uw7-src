This is the OSF/1 Release 1.1.1 version of Larry Wall's patch program.
It has been modified to conform to POSIX 1003.2a (User Portability Extensions) 
Draft 8.

This is a list of differences between the OSF/1 patch and the above revision:

 - Added the file pathnames.h which contains system pathnames to
   things used by patch (the ed utility, /dev/tty).

 - common.h now includes several more header files to make prototypes
   visible and for internationalization. (unistd.h, stdlib.h ,etc.)

 - The -b switch (per POSIX UPE) now takes no argument and must be given
   to save the original versions of the file being patched.

 - The program has been messagized, with all messages collected in
   the file patch.msg. Messages are retrieved using catgets().

 - All yes/no questions now use the OSF/1 routine rpmatch() which
   returns yes or no based on the current locale.  They also prompt
   using the locale's yes/no strings.

 - patch does a setlocale() call before doing any work.

 - Message are no longer 'constructed' due to message catalog translation
   constraints.

 - Argument parsing has been reworked to use the POSIX getopt() routine.

 - The support for arguments of the style '-F=4' or '-p=5' was removed
   as not documented and difficult to do while using getopt().

 - The -i <patchfile> option was added per the POSIX UPE

 - A usage message was added.

 - The debug switch (-x) now requires an argument.

 - The version output (-v) also gives the OSF version info.
