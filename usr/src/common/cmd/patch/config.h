 *	    4 = supports comparisons between pointers to void functions and
 *		    addresses of void functions

 *	The package designer should define VOIDUSED to indicate the requirements
 *	of the package.  This can be done either by #defining VOIDUSED before
 *	including config.h, or by defining defvoidused in Myinit.U.  If the
 *	level of void support necessary is not present, defines void to int.
