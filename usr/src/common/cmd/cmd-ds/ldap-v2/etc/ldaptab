# ldaptab
# ~~~~~~~
# This is the central configuration file for ldap. It contains a list 
# of the ldap daemon configurations on the system. It is used by:
# 	ldapstart
#	ldapstop
#	The LDAP manager SCOAdmin application
#
# Each entry in ldaptab should be a colon (:) delimited line with the
# following fields in order:
#
# identifier	- unique identifier for the daemon (used by GUI)
#		  this identifier should contain no whitespaces
# port		- the port on which the active slapd daemon listens for
#		  ldap requests
# masterfile	- the master configuration file (typically called slapd.conf)
# sysloglevel   - the amount of debug information which goes to 
#		  /var/adm/log/osmlog. The range is 0 (no info) to 65535
#		  (full debugging). Full debugging will fill up the system
#		  log very quickly
# startatboot	- if the entry equals 'on' the daemon will be started at boot,
#		  otherwise the entry should be 'off'
#		  
# identifier     port    masterfile    sysloglevel   startatboot
