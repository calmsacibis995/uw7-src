# PRINTPROG is the default print program and PRINTPATH is a list of directories
# the system should search for print programs.  The print program specified for
# PRINTPROG, as well as the print programs invoked by the user with the PRINTER
# command, must reside in one of these directories.  Change these variables to
# specify the desired default print program and search paths.  If you do not
# define PRINTPROG, the server attempts to execute /usr/pci/bin/pciprint.  A
# sample pciprint program is in the host-side distribution.
