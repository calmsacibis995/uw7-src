# Administering Network Printers
#
# The UNIX server provides the following arguments to this shell script:
#
#	pciprint -i %1 -o %2
#
# where %1 is the input code page (the DOS code page) and %2 is the output code
# set (the UNIX code set).  Thus the arguments are exactly what charconv needs
# to perform a proper conversion from the DOS side to the UNIX side, which in
# some cases may be necessary to ensure that printer output is readable.  If
# this is necessary, the lp command below may be commented out and replaced
# with the following:
#
#	/usr/bin/charconv $* | lp
#
# Beware, however, that doing this will make printer output from many applic-
# ations unreadable; in general, if character conversion is necessary it is
# better to temporarily set up the printer command via PRINTER.EXE from DOS.
#
# With the PRINTER command, users can request that print jobs from DOS applic-
# ations be sent to printers attached to the host.  They can associate any of
# the printer ports--LPT1, LPT2, and LPT3--with network printers.  When the
# user specifies network printing without specifying a print program for the
# print stream, automatically spools print jobs from the specified printer port
# to the default print program defined in /usr/pci/bin/pciprint, which is in-
# stalled with the host software.
#
# As system administrator, you need to be sure that the default print command
# and options in the pciprint script are appropriate for your system and for
# the kind of print jobs that users might send.  You can modify the print com-
# mand and its options as necessary for your environment, for example to accom-
# modate multiple host printers.
#
# Remember that users may be sending plain ASCII text files as well as Post-
# Script files.  On some systems a single print command such as lp can recog-
# nize the differences between these two types of print requests and process
# each appropriately.  When a single print command cannot handle all possible
# types of print requests, you should set the default print command to handle
# the most common requests and provide users with other print commands they can
# specify to override the default when they connect network printers with the
# PRINTER command.
#
# In addition to setting the appropriate default print command in pciprint, you
# must perform any necessary printer administration functions, such as connect-
# ing the physical printer to a logical printer name.  These are typically done
# using a system administration tool such as lpadmin.  Refer to your UNIX oper-
# ating system administrator's documentation for appropriate syntax and proc-
# edures.


# Default printer program (replace with your own):

lp
