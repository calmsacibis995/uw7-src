UnixWare Software Development Kit (SDK)
 
This directory contains some simple demonstration programs for C++ Standard
Components, a C++ foundation class library that is part of the UnixWare
Software Development Kit (SDK).

These programs correspond to examples given in the Standard Components 
Programmer's Guide.  (There may be some slight changes from the versions found
in the text.)  The calendar_sc demo, which uses a number of components, is
found at the end of the "Getting Started" chapter; the other demos are found
within the tutorial chapter corresponding to the demo's name.

To build and run these demos, simply do a "make".
