			The Game of Life

This is a demo to show how SVR4.2MP threads improve the response time
of a program that has inherent parallelism in its algorithm. The game
of life is used as the example.

Various options are supported.  The number of LWPs, number of threads,
and binding of threads to LWPS are supported for the threaded version.
The number of iterations through the matrix of life, the gridsize
used, and the scaling factor are supported for both process and threaded
versions.  There is also a bind to processor property.  It is currently
not implemented.

The source code is structured as follows:
	- life.c is the multithreaded version.
	- plife.c is the single (traditional) process version.
