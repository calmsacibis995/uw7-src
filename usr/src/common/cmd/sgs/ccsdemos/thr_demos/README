SVR4.2 MP Software Development Kit (SDK)

The SVR4.2 MP Software Development Kit (SDK) contains a number of
sample programs that use the SVR4.2 MP Threads Library interfaces.
These sample programs use a subset of the available thread interfaces
and provide an overview of threads programming.

For more information on programming to the threads library, please
reference the manual pages included in the SDK. 

The sample programs included are:

  1.  life - This is a demo to show how threads on SVR4.2 MP
         improve the response time of a program that has inherent
         parallelism in its algorithm.  The game of life is used
         as an example. wksh is used to visually present the results
         of the runs.

  2.  quicksort - This is the quick sort sorting algorithm implemented
         using threads. wksh is used to visually present the results
	 of the runs.

  3.  rpc - This is a sample program that uses threads to make
         Remote Procedure Calls to a remote server.  This source code
	 is provided for reference.
  
  4.  sync - Sevaral programs to demostrate the use of the synchronization
	mechanisms provided by threads library.  Refer to the source
	code for comments on how to use them.
	Programs included are:
		demo_barrier.c - demonstrates the use of blocking barrier
		demo_cond.c - demonstrates the use of mutex and condition
			      variable
		demo_rmutex.c - demonstrates the use of recursive mutex
		demo_rwlock.c - demonstrates the use of read/write lock
		demo_sbarrier.c - demonstrates the use of spin barrier
		demo_sema.c - demonstrates the use of semaphore
		demo_spin.c - demonstrates the use of spin lock
