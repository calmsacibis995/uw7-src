		Threads/RPC Programing Sample Source

   This is a simple program which creates a requested number of
   threads. Each thread then makes Remote Procedure Calls to a
   server specified by the environment variable SVC_HOST. The
   transport used is specified by the environment variable NETID.
  
   The flag passed to "thr_create()" specifies that a new Light
   Weight Process be created for each thread. This is exessive
   for multiplexed threads, and only a limited number of LWPs
   should normally be used.
  
   This program is for source reference only.
