#ident "$Header$"
#
#	Devconfig provides a means of configuring devices by service.
#	Two types of configuration are available: module configuration
#	for STREAMS devices, and timeout configuration.
#
#	FORMAT:
#
#	service=<service name>	device=<device type> \
#				pop=<STREAMS module list> \
#				push=<STREAMS module list> \
#				connecttime=<time> \
#				expecttime=<time> \
#				msgtime=<time>
#
#	where service name is "uucico" or "cu", device type is the device or
#	caller type (3rd field in Systems file, 1st field in Devices file),
#	STREAMS module list is a colon-separated list of STREAMS modules
#	to be pushed(popped) on(off) this stream, and connecttime, expecttime,
#	and msgtime specify an integer number of seconds.
#
#	The examples below are for the STARLAN NETWORK and assume that both
#	cu & uucico are going through login and so need full tty capabilities.
#
#	EXAMPLE:
#		service=cu	device=STARLAN	push=ntty:tirdwr
#		service=uucico	device=STARLAN	push=ntty:tirdwr
#
#	To use "cu" over the TCP/IP network use one of the entries
#	below, depending on the device type you need:
#               service=cu      device=TCP  push=ntty:tirdwr
#               service=cu      device=CS  push=ntty:tirdwr
#
#	Note: The tirdwr and ntty modules are part of the NSU package.  Other 
#	modules needed to provide tty capabilities must be supplied by the
#	network provider.
#
service=cu      device=CS  push=ntty:tirdwr
