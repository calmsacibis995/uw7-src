# Some sample entries:
# NOTE - all lines must have at least 5 fields 
#    use '-' for unused fields
# The Devices file is used in conjunction with the Dialers file.
# Types that appear in the 5th field must be either built-in
#  functions (801, Sytek, TCP, DK, CS)
#  or standard functions whose name appears in the first
#  field in the Dialers file.
# Three escape characters may appear in this file.
# - \D which means take the phone #/token (field 5) from
#	the Systems file and substitute it as is.
#	This should always be used for standard dialer functions
#	since they will generally use \T in their Dialers
#	file entry if appropriate.
# - \T which means take the phone #/token (field 5) from
#	the Systems file and substitute it after translating
#	it using the Dialcodes file. This should only be
#	used with built-in functions which require translation.
# NOTE: if neither \D nor \T is used where one is expected, \T is
#	used for built-in functions, and \D is used for standard
#	functions referencing the Dialers file.
#
# ---Standard Connection Server provided connection using network selection
# CS  - - - CS
#
# ---Standard modem line
# ACU cul02 cua02 1200 801
# ACU contty - 1200 penril \D
# ACU contty - 1200 penril
# (this is equivalent to the previous entry)
#
# ---Telebit modem line. The M flag allows the device to be
#    opened without waiting for a carrier.
# ACU tty00h,M - 19200 telebit \D
#
# ---A direct line so 'cu -lculd0' will work
# Direct culd0 - 4800 direct
#
# ---A ventel modem on a develcon switch (vent is the token given to
#	the develcon to reach the ventel modem)
# ACU culd0 - 1200 develcon vent ventel \D
#
# ---To reach a system on the local develcon switch
# Develcon culd0 - Any develcon \D
#
# ---Access a direct connection to a particular system
# systemx term/00 - Any direct
#
# where the Systems file looks like
# systemx Any systemx 1200 unused  "" in:-\r\d-in: nuucp word: nuucp
#	(The third field in Systems matches the first field in Devices)
#
# ---To connect to any system on the DATAKIT VCS network
# DK DK 0 Any DK \D
#
# ---To connect to a system on a Datakit in nj/ho
# DKho - uucp Any DK nj/ho/\D
#
# ---To use an ACU that is connected to Datakit that DK does not understand
#	how to talk to directly
# ACU - 0 Any DK vent ventel \D
#
# ---To use a dialer that the Datakit understands how to chat with
#	This is a special case where the translation must be done by the
#	Devices file processing.
# ACU DKacu 0 Any DK py/garage/door.\T
#

########	Direct Connections
#
# ---The following entry can be used for directly connected lines.
#
#		Direct term/01 - 9600 direct
#
#	In general, if a remote port is set up as bidirectional (-b
#	option of ttymon) or "wait-for-read" (-r option to ttymon), a
#	a carriage return must be entered to get the login: prompt.
#
#	In general, if a remote port is a Trusted Path (TP) device,
#	the user must enter the SAK to get the login: prompt.
#
#	Therefore, if a remote port is both bidirectional and a
#	TP device, two carriage returns must generally be entered
#	to get the login: prompt.
#
#	The 'uudirect' Dialer is defined to handle these conditions
#	transparently to the user and can be used in place of 'direct'
#	in the previous example.
#
#		Direct term/01 - 9600 uudirect
#
########	Transport Interface
#
# ---To use a STREAMS network that conforms to the Transport Interface
#	with a direct connection to login service (i.e., without
#	explicitly using the Network Listener Service dial script):
#
# networkx,eg devicex - - TLIS \D
#
#	The Systems file entry looks like:
#
# systemx Any networkx - addressx in:--in: nuucp word: nuucp
#
#	You must replace systemx, networkx, addressx, and devicex with system
#	name, network name, network address and network device, respectively.
#	For example, entries for machine "sffoo" on a STARLAN NETWORK might
#	look like:
#		sffoo Any STARLAN - sffoo in:--in: nuucp word: nuucp
#	and:
#		STARLAN,eg starlan - - TLIS \D
#
# ---To use a STREAMS network that conforms to the Transport Interface
#	and that uses the Network Listener Service dial script to negotiate
#	for a server:
#
# networkx,eg devicex - - TLIS \D nls.<service_code>
#
#	For example, 
#
# TCP tcp - - TLIS \D nls.uucico
#
#
# ---To use a non-STREAMS network that conforms to the Transport 
#	Interface and that uses the Network Listener Service dial script
#	to negotiate for a server:
#
# networkx,eg devicex - - TLI \D nls.<service_code>
#
#	<service_code> can be either "cu" or "uucico"
########
#
#
# NOTE: blank lines and lines that begin with a <space>, <tab>, or # are 
#		ignored.
#	protocols can be specified as a comma-subfield of the device type
#		either in the Devices file (where device type is field 1)
#		or in the Systems file (where it is field 3).
