#
#	Config provides a means of configuring certain parameters
#	within BNU at run time.
#
#	FORMAT:
#
#	<parameter>=<value>
#
#	where <parameter> is the name of one of the configurable parameters,
#	and <value> is the value to be assigned to that parameter.
#	
#	PARAMETERS:
#
#	The following list provides the names of the configurable parameters
#	and describes the values which may be assigned to them. 
#
#		<parameter>	<value>
#
#		AUTH		Is authentication required of remote execution
#				requests? <yes|req> or <no|opt>
#
#		KEYS		If authentication is required, which key
#				management scheme is to be used? <cr1>
#
#		Protocol	prioritized subset of valid protocols provided
#				at compile time, with optional protocol-specific
#				parameters in parentheses.
#
#		PARITY		sets the data parity for cu. (none, even and
#				odd the valid values.)
#
#		CHARSIZE	sets the number of bits processed on the line
#				for cu. (7 and 8 are the valid values.) 
#
#	EXAMPLE:
#
#		Protocol=G(7,512)g
#
#
	PARITY=none
	CHARSIZE=8
