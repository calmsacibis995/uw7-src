ABSTRACT:IAF Scheme cr1 Key Management
	The cr1 menu allows you to add, remove, and modify
	the cryptographic keys used by the cr1 scheme of the
	Identification and Authentication Facility. It also
	allows you to set the master key used to access these
	keys.

add:Add an Entry to the Key File
	The add task allows you to add cryptographic keys for
	use by the IAF cr1 scheme in obtaining authenticated
	identities for both participants in a communication
	session.

modify:Modify an Entry in the Key File
	The modify task allows you to change the cryptographic
	keys used by the IAF cr1 scheme in obtaining authenticated
	identities for both participants in a communication
	session.

remove:Remove an Entry from the Key File
	The remove task allows you to remove the cryptographic
	keys used by the IAF cr1 scheme in obtaining authenticated
	identities for both participants in a communication
	session.

set:Set the Master Key for the Key File
	The set task allows you to set a cryptographic key
	for use by the IAF cr1 scheme in maintaining an
	encrypted list of shared keys.

start:Start the Keymaster Daemon
	The start task allows you to start the keymaster daemon
	process. The keymaster daemon manages all accesses to the
	cr1 key file.

stop:Stop the Keymaster Daemon
	The stop task allows you to stop the keymaster daemon
	process. This action prevents all further access to the cr1
	key file.

loc_prin:Local Principal
	Enter the principal name of a user on your
	local system. A local principal name should have the
	form "logname@local_system" or "local_system!logname".
	Omit the logname to refer to the local system itself.

rem_prin:Remote Principal
	Enter the principal name of a user on a remote
	system. A remote principal name should have the
	form "logname@remote_system" or "remote_system!logname".
	Omit the logname to refer to the remote system itself.

scheme_names:Scheme Name:
	Enter the name of the encryption scheme.
