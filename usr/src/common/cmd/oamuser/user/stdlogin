#ident	"@(#)stdlogin	1.2"

#	This is the default standard login provided to a user
#	running csh.  Users are expected to edit it to meet their 
#	own needs.
#
#	If you have a login that is attempting to read from the
#	terminal or is using the stty(1) command to set terminal 
#	settings, you may find that GRAPHICAL LOGIN does not give
#	you a desktop metaphor session.
#
#	To update your profile, you should surround any section
#	that reads from the terminal or performs stty(1) commands
#	with the following 'if' statement:
#
#	if ( "$?XDM_LOGIN" != "yes" )
#	then
#		:
#		read from the terminal or stty(1) commands
#	fi
