# 	This script will start the 'cr1' keymaster daemon
#	if Enhanced Security is not configured in the running /unix.
#
#	The -n option indicates that the keys databsae is unencrypted.
#	If you wish to have an encrypted keys database, you should
#	remove the entry, since the keymaster must be started manually.
#
#	If your system does not support DES encryption and decryption,
#	add the -s <scheme> option to indicate the name 'cr1.enigma'
#	to use the enigma encryption/decryption mechanism.
