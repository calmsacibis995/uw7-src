You are deleting a network in the middle of a series.  Network\nstatistics recorded in a linear array may be misreported by the\n/usr/bin/netstat command.  The 'unit' numbers are used as an index.  You\nmay decide to manually correct the %s file\nso the unit numbers for each device family prefix start at zero and\nincrease incrementally.\n\n
%# 117;;
\nIP host names and addresses identify all machines on your network.  The\nhost name is a mnemonic name you choose to match a numeric IP address.\nThe TCP/IP Internet address is the address by which host %s\nwill be known on the network.\n
%# 118;;
Typically, an Internet address specified in dot notation will consist\nof your system's network number and the machine's unique host number.\nA typical Internet address looks like 192.9.200.44, where 192.9.200\nis the network number and 44 is the machine's host number.  These\naddresses must be administered by a central authority on your network.\n
%# 119;;
Note that using unofficial addresses can lead to network failures that\nare difficult to diagnose.  Until an address is available, it is\nimpossible to communicate with other machines through the network\n\n

\nThe most commonly used ifconfig option list for Ethernet(TM) devices is:\n\t-trailers\nThis is the default ifconfig option list option for your network.  The\n-trailers option is used to synchronize network packet trailer functionality.\n\n
%# 132;;
Some machines need to apply 'netmask' and 'broadcast' ifconfig options to allow\nrouting between networks.  The netmask argument identifies the network and\nmachine portions of the address.  The broadcast address is usually the network\naddress with '255' filling in the machine address portion(s).  The 'ClassC'\noption will assign the ifconfig options:\n\t%s\n\n
%# 133;;
On Berkeley style networks, the broadcast address has '0' filling in the machine\naddress portion(s).  The BerkeleyC option will assign the ifconfig options:\n\t%s\n\n
%# 134;;
Other network devices and protocols may require different ifconfig options.\nSome actually require no ifconfig options.  Please refer to the ifconfig(1m)\nmanual page or documentation specific to your network device if you need other\noptions.  Answer '%s' to the prompt to customize your own ifconfig options.\n\n
