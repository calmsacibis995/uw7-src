This is the slocal program extracted from the mh distribution.

It provide MMDF compatible .maildelivery processing and is designed
to be called from a sendmail .forward file.

It has been ported to user our message store C-Client API.
The port was a major hack, this was ok because slocal
is never going to change (at least our version of it).
