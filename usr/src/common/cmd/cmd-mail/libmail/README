@(#)README	11.1

This library is the libmail shared library
stripped down to include only the documented
SVR4 libmail locking primitives.

In addition we include the mailrdlock and mailurdlock calls.
Maybe we can get them to be part of SVR4 mail primitives.

maillock.h is part of the distribution and goes in /usr/include.

We produce both shared and static versions.
All of the mail stuff links with static versions for product.
