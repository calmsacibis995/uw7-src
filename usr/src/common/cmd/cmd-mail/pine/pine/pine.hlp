         Help text for the Pine mailer
This file is in a format created to be turned into text strings in a C
program and to support a few other features such as page numbering and
alternate versions that are created at run time.  There are two shell
scripts that run on this.  Cmplhelp.sh is the first and turns this into a
C file (helptext.c) of text strings that are compiled and linked. The
other program, cmplhlp2.sh, turns this into a .h file (helptext.h) with
extern string definitions of the strings in the .c file.  The code that
actually processes these files while pine is running is in help.c

The lines with "===== xxxx ====" divide the different help screens.  The
xxx is the name of the variable that strings will be put in, which are
also declared in helptext.h.

# is a comment

{x:y} constructs are the key bindings, either x or y is used.
      x and y are best the same length so things always line up

__   doesn't do anything but help keep things lined up in this file.  It is
     removed before printing to the screen (except for ^_).

To actually get a { in the text use '{{:{}'.  To get a } make sure it is not
matched by a {

The text is formatted in emacs with the fill column set to 78.

Text with ______ indents is formatted with fill column at 82
___include <filename> includes a file at run time.  It should be
followed by "___end_include" with text to be displayed if the file
is unopenable in between.
Any occurance of ___version will be replaced with the current version
number as defined in "pine.h"
Any occurance of ___cdate will be replace with the date and time the currently
running binary was compiled.
Any occurance of ___tdate will be replaced with the current day's date
and time.

NOTE: Several sections of help text which weren't being used were removed
at RCS version number 4.122.  In particular, there were some placeholders
with help text for the config screen and the composer that didn't have any
reasonable place to be called from.

SENDING STRATEGY

Beginning with 3.92, Pine sends messages in a different way.
Previously, Pine created a temp file containing the message to be
sent, and invoked sendmail in a way that would cause it to derive
the SMTP envelope information from the message headers.  This had
several disadvantages, including the inability to support ESMTP
options such as 8BITMIME.  So now Pine, by default, invokes sendmail
such that it can directly interact via SMTP commands.  However,
the direct interaction has caused undesirable side effects at some
sites.  For example:
   
 o If your sendmail is configured to do address validation, it may
   take significantly longer for sendmail to accept the message
   than it used to.  The user sees this delay in Pine.

 o Some sendmails are configured to generate X-Authentication-Warning (see
   below for more information on this warning) headers when directly
   invoked by Pine. 

If you experience sending difficulties, the first thing to try is
setting the following configuration variable:  smtp-server=localhost

If that doesn't help, it's possible to revert to Pine's previous method
of sending via a temporary file.  In the contrib/utils directory of the
distribution, there is a shell script named \"sendit.sh\"

To revert to the previous sending-method, install this script and set the
sendmail-path variable to its path. 

X-AUTHENTICATION-WARNING

Recent versions of Pine use a default sending method that causes the
header:

  X-Authentication-Warning: <hostname>: <user> owned process doing -bs 

to be added to outgoing mail in some cases.  This header is added by
sendmail version 8 when the sendmail configuration option:

  PrivacyOptions=authwarnings

is set.  There are a couple ways to fix this.

1. Don't set the authwarnings option in sendmail.cf.  
2. In the Pine configuration, set smtp-server to some value.  This could
   be done globally for everyone in /usr/local/lib/pine.conf or by
   individuals in their own configurations. 

The smtp-server variable may be set to the name of any host which is
running an SMTP server.  Often, the host you are running Pine on will also
be running a sendmail daemon.  In that case, it is usually enough to set: 

   smtp-server=localhost

This works because \"localhost\" is usually a pseudo-hostname for the
loopback interface on a Unix host.  If \"localhost\" doesn't work, you can
try the actual name of the host you are running Pine on, or the name of
some other host which is running an SMTP server.  For example:

   smtp-server=somehost.company.com

BACKGROUND POSTING                                       (EXPERIMENTAL!!!)

New in Pine 3.94 is an EXPERIMENTAL feature permitting optional sending
of messages \"in the background\".  Choosing this option at the \"Send?\"
confirmation prompt causes Pine to split into two processes; one returns
immediately to your control while the other continues sending the
message.

It does not alter the method Pine uses to send messages (via SMTP,
typically), but it does affect the way in which errors are reported.
Normal, interactive sending requires you to wait until the receiving
transport agent has accepted the message.  Usually, errors are reported
immediately, and Pine returns you to the composer with the error message
displayed.  With \"background\" sending chosen, Pine can't return to the
message editor.  Pine will display an error message, but you need to
resume posting manually by typing \"C\" and answering \"Y\"es to the
\"Continue INTERRUPTED message?\" prompt.

NOTE: As this feature requires specific support (i.e., the waitpid system
      call) from the operating system, it is not available on all flavors
      of Unix.  Therefore, you may not find it in your \"Setup Config\"
      screen.  See the feature's help text in the Config screen for more
      caveats.

STABILITY AND LIFE EXPECTANCY

Pine 3.94 corrects many of the bugs we failed to resolve (or introduced) 
in version 3.93, which was primarily a bug-fix release for 3.92, our last
major release.

We are anxious to now focus our attention on Pine 4.00, which will mostly
have the same functionality as 3.94, but will use the new IMAP4-capable
c-client libraries in preparation for utilizing certain IMAP4 extensions
later on.  No doubt it will also contain more bug fixes, and perhaps a few
new features. 

---------------------
| (2) PC-PINE NOTES |
---------------------

PC-Pine is now available for Windows/Winsock in both 16 and 32 bit
versions, as well as the following DOS versions: packet driver, Novell
LWP, FTP PC-TCP, Sun PC-NFS.  Only the 32 bit Windows version has full
caching enabled; thus it should be noticeably faster than the DOS and
16 bit Windows versions.  Sorting, however, is still slow.

Some specific limitations of the DOS version (these do not apply to
the Windows/Winsock version of PC-Pine):
   o The unix-pipe-cmd function is not available.
   o There is no spelling checker.
   o Alternate editor function is not available.
   o Memory: the DOS version needs about 500K out of 640K.
   o The DOS version can't run image viewer from within Pine, due to memory.
   o Messages (excluding attachments) must fit in DOS memory,
     however, attachments may be any size.

Additional notes:

-The Windows/Winsock version of PC-Pine is not a full GUI Windows
 application, however, version 3.92 introduces quite a few GUI
 amenities, including: scroll bars, pull-down menus, expanded mouse
 support, etc.

-While message folders may be either local or remote, several support
 files must be available on the local disk.  In particular your
 PINERC config file, ADDRBOOK, NEWSRC, and PINE.SIG (your signature file).
 Other files (postponed and interrupted messages, debug files) are also
 stored locally.  Some users of both PC-Pine and Unix Pine must worry
 about keeping their pinerc, address book, and newsrc files in sync.
 This may be done using remote file system protocols or manual copying.
 Remote access to these support files is *definitely* planned for the future.

-The PC-PINE message folder format is based on byte-counts for maximum
 efficiency, so they must not be edited. The format is non-standard, but
 conversion utilities would not be difficult. This format is supported in
 Unix Pine as well.  PC-Pine can also open Unix-style folders for
 READ-ONLY access.

-Don't expect to display a picture without exiting PC-Pine for DOS, due
 to DOS memory limitations.  In some configurations, there *may* be enough
 memory for the viewer and a small image, but don't count on it.  With
 PC-Pine for Windows/Winsock, the memory constraints are greatly
 diminished, and viewing image attachments seems to work quite well.  We
 have been testing with the \"lview\" package by Leonardo Loureiro, which
 can be obtained from oak.oakland.edu or any other SimTel mirror site.

---------------------
| (3) Configuration |
---------------------

Configuration precedence.

There are several levels of Pine configuration.  Configuration values at
a given level override corresponding values at lower levels.  In order of
increasing precedence:

 o built-in defaults,
 o system-wide pine.conf file,
 o personal .pinerc file (may be set via built-in Setup/Config menu.),
 o command-line options,
 o system-wide pine.conf.fixed file.

There is one exception to the rule that configuration values are replaced
by the value of the same option in a higher-precedence file:
the feature-list variable has values that are additive, but can be
negated by prepending \"no-\" in front of an individual feature name.

File name defaults.

Notes:

 o <exe dir> = directory where pine.exe found.
 o <pinerc dir> = directory where pinerc found.
 o * = default file name is overridable in pinerc.
 o $HOME, if not explicitly set, defaults to root of the current drive.
 o $MAILCAPS, if set, is used in lieu of the default mailcap search paths.
 o + between the mailcap paths implies that the two files are combined.
 o ; between other default paths implies that the first one found is used.

Pine looks for most support files in the same directory it finds its
personal configuration file (pinerc).  The -p command-line flag may be
used to specify a particular path name for the pinerc file.  If a
pinerc file does not exist, it will be created (if directory permissions
allow).  In PC-Pine, if -p or $PINERC are not defined, Pine will look
in $HOME\\PINE and the directory containing the PINE.EXE.  If a PINERC
file does not exist in either one, it will create one in the first of those
two directories that is writable.  In detail:

PC-Pine:

 executable     <DOS search path>\\pine.exe
 help index     <exe dir>\\pine.ndx
 help text      <exe dir>\\pine.hlp

 pers config    $PINERC  ;  $HOME\\pine\\pinerc  ;  <exe dir>\\pinerc
 global cfg     $PINECONF

 password       <pinerc dir>\\pine.pwd
 debug          <pinerc dir>\\pinedebg.txt
 crash          <pinerc dir>\\pinecrsh.txt
 signature*     <pinerc dir>\\pine.sig
 addressbook*   <pinerc dir>\\addrbook
 addrbook lu    <pinerc dir>\\addrbook.lu    (appends .lu to addrbk name.)
 mailcap*       <pinerc dir>\\mailcap  +  <exe dir>\\mailcap
 mimetypes*     <pinerc dir>\\mimetype +  <exe dir>\\mimetype
 newsrc*        $HOME\newsrc (if exists, else) <pinerc dir>\newsrc
 sentmail*      $HOME\\mail\\sentmail.mtx
 postponed*     $HOME\\mail\\postpond.mtx
 interrupted    $HOME\\mail\\intruptd

Unix Pine:

 executable     <Unix search path>/pine
 persnl cfg     ~/.pinerc
 global cfg     /usr/local/lib/pine.conf
 fixed cfg      /usr/local/lib/pine.conf.fixed
 local help     /usr/local/lib/pine.info

 interrupted    ~/.pine-interrupted-mail
 debug          ~/.pine-debugN
 crash		~/.pine-crash
 newsrc*        ~/.newsrc
 signature*     <pinerc dir>/.signature
 addressbook*   <pinerc dir>/.addressbook
 addrbook lu    <pinerc dir>/.addressbook.lu  (appends .lu to addrbk name.)
 postponed*     ~/mail/postponed-msgs
 sentmail*      ~/mail/sent-mail
 mailcap*       ~/.mailcap + /etc/mailcap
                           + /usr/etc/mailcap + /usr/local/etc/mailcap
 mimetypes*     ~/.mime.types + /etc/mime.types + /usr/local/lib/mime.types

 news-spool	varies across Unix flavors, e.g. /usr/spool/news or /var/news
 active-news	varies across Unix flavors, e.g. /usr/lib/news/active
 lock files     /tmp/.\\usr\\spool\\mail\\xxxx
 inbox          /usr/spool/mail/xxxx
 password       /etc/passwd

Mailcap files.

Pine honors the mailcap configuration system for specifying external
programs for handling attachments.  The mailcap file maps MIME attachment
types to the external programs loaded on your system which can display
and/or print the file.  A sample mailcap file comes bundled with the Pine
distribution.  It includes comments which explain the syntax you need to
use for mailcap.  With the mailcap file, any program (mail readers,
newsreaders, WWW clients) can use the same configuration for handling
MIME-encoded data.

MIME-Types files.

Pine uses mime-types files (.mime.types or MIMETYPE) to determine
what Content-Type to use for labeling an attached file, based on
the file extension.  That is, this file provides a mapping between
filename extensions and MIME content-types.

Environment variables.

PC-Pine uses the following environment variables:

  PINERC      (Optional path to pinerc file.)
  PINECONF    (Optional path to global pine config file.)
  HOME
  TMP or TEMP
  COMSPEC
  MAILCAPS    (A *semicolon* delimited list of path names to mailcap files.)

Unix Pine uses the following environment variables:

| (5) HISTORY |
---------------

Pine was originally conceived in 1989 as a simple, easy-to-use mailer for
administrative staff at the University of Washington in Seattle.  This
constituency had previously been using a very nice mail system derived
from UCLA's \"Ben\" mailer for the MVS operating system, but when the cost
of maintaining our MVS system became prohibitive, we needed to find a
Unix-based mailer that preserved the user-interface strengths of \"Ben\".
Our goal was to provide a mailer that naive users could use without fear
of making mistakes.  We wanted to cater to users who were less interested
in learning the mechanics of using electronic mail than in doing their
jobs; users who perhaps had some computer anxiety.  We felt the way to do
this was to have a system that didn't do surprising things and provided
immediate feedback on each operation; a mailer that had a limited set of
carefully-selected functions.

At that time, we could not find any Unix mailer (commercial or freely
available) that met our requirements.  Consequently, we reluctantly
concluded that we would need to develop our own.  The Elm mailer seemed
like a reasonable starting point since its source code was freely
available, so we started modifying it.  Today there is virtually no Elm
code left, and Pine has evolved so that many \"power-user\" features may
be (optionally) enabled.  We have tried to remain true to our original
simplicity and ease-of-use goals by providing *optional* features for
sophisticated users.  In fact, if none of Pine's options are enabled, the
latest version has almost the same look-and-feel as the very first
version.

One of the greatest problems with most mailers on Unix systems is the
editor.  One can normally choose between emacs and vi.  We experimented
with some versions of emacs and settled on a hacked version of micro
emacs. Eventually it became heavily modified and tightly integrated with
the rest of Pine.  One of the main features of having a tightly coupled
editor is that it can guide the user through editing the header of the
message, and Pine takes great care to do this.  A very simple and
efficient interface to the Unix spell command was also added.  The emacs-
style key bindings were retained, though most of the other wild and
wonderful emacs functions were not.  The Pine composition editor is also
available as a very simple stand alone editor named \"pico\".

Also working at the University of Washington is the original author of the
Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP).  IMAP is a functional superset of
POP, and provides a way to manipulate mailboxes on remote servers as if
they were local.  Specific advantages of IMAP over POP include: support
for inbox access from multiple computers, access to more than one remote
folder, selective access to MIME message parts, and support for
disconnected operation.

Not long after the Pine project began, The IMAP author had finished
writing the \"c-client\" library as an interface to IMAP and as a switch
between drivers for IMAP mailboxes, Berkeley mail files and Tenex mail
files.  In time, \"c-client\" became a full messaging API with support for
RFC-822 parsing, MIME parsing and decoding, SMTP and NNTP drivers, and so
forth.  Great care was taken to make the code writing the mail files
robust against disks filling up, and inter-process locking in order to
guarantee mail file consistency.  It was clear that Pine would benefit
greatly from using the c-client to access mail storage so the original
low-level Elm code was replaced by calls to c-client library routines.
Consequently Pine can write and access a variety of different mail file
formats and new ones can be added by creating a simple driver.  In
addition the c-client does a very careful job of doing all the RFC-822
header parsing and achieves the highest compliance with the RFC.

Most of the work done on Pine from 6/92 to 6/93 focused on changes needed
to support a truly distributed electronic messaging environment (e.g.
remote folder manipulation), and getting Pine to run on DOS (which was a
*lot* of work).  The first version of PC-Pine (3.84) was released in July
1993, and included first steps toward integrating news and email access in
Pine. Doing the DOS port was very difficult for a variety of reasons, but
especially because of DOS memory management (or lack thereof).  However,
simply porting Pine 3.07 to DOS was not sufficient.  For a desktop mailer
such as PC-Pine to be useful at UW, it was necessary to fully support
access to existing *remote* saved-message folders, as well as local
(desktop) folders -- and of course, the remote INBOX.  Accomplishing this
required extensions to IMAP, a new version of the IMAPd server code, and
extensive work in Pine to support multiple collections of folders.

The principal reason for porting Unix Pine to DOS/Windows was to obviate
the need for PC users to transfer files between their PC and the Unix
system running Pine.  Now it is possible to save messages directly to the
PC's filesystem, and to directly include PC files in outgoing messages.
And with Pine's MIME capability, binary files (e.g. word processing
documents, spreadsheets, image files, executables) may be directly
attached to your messages.

With both Pine 3.90 and 3.92, significant new functionality has been added,
as can be seen by the growing number of features that can be set via
Setup/Config screen.  Next will come integration of the IMAP4-capable
c-client libraries, forming the basis of Pine 4.00.

| Introduction |
----------------

PINE(tm) is the University of Washington's \"Program for Internet News and
Email\".  It is intended to be an easy-to-use program for sending,
receiving, and filing Internet electronic mail messages and bulletin board
(Netnews) messages. Pine supports the following Internet protocols and
specifications:
                SMTP  - Simple Mail Transport Protocol
                NNTP  - Network News Transport Protocol
                MIME  - Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions
                IMAP  - Internet Message Access Protocol

MIME allows you to attach any kind of file to your message, provided that
your recipient also has MIME-capable mail software (which is readily
available for most types of computers, although some proprietary mail
systems do not yet support MIME).  IMAP allows access to mailboxes on
remote mailservers as if they were local.

Although originally designed for inexperienced email users, Pine has
evolved to support many advanced features.  There are an ever-growing
number of configuration and personal-preference options, though which of
them are available to you is determined by your local system managers.

| Pine Help |
-------------

Pine help is context-sensitive.  In other words, each Pine screen you use
will have its own help text, explaining the choices available for that
screen.  This particular Help section is unusual in that it will not only
describe the specific commands available from the MAIN MENU, but also
provide an overview of Pine operation.

In addition to this general help on Pine, Release Notes on the current
Pine version are also available from the MAIN MENU.  Press {F9:R} to
browse the release notes.  These include changes since the last release,
notes for PC-Pine, configuration information, the history of the Pine
project, credits, and legal notices.

Pine files and documentation are available via FTP or WWW:
  ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine
  http://www.cac.washington.edu/pine

For a copy of the current Pine \"Frequently Asked Questions\" (FAQ) list,
send an empty message to pine-faq@cac.washington.edu  --or, if it is
available at your site, use the Setup/Update command under the Main Menu.

If you would like to print *all* of Pine's internal help text for a little
light bedtime reading, then press {F12:Z} now.  (This assumes that the
copy of Pine you are using has been properly configured for printing
at your site.)

| Giving Commands in Pine |
---------------------------

COMMANDS: The bottom two lines of the screen are always used to list the
commands you can give.  You press the keys that are highlighted to give
the command.  The commands for getting help and going back to the main
menu are always present (except when viewing help as you are now).

{:OTHER COMMANDS: The \"Other Commands\" function changes the keys you see}
{:at the bottom of any screen.  In some cases there are 3 different pages}
{:of keys which it toggles through.  ALL COMMANDS ARE ACTIVE, even if they}
{:are not currently showing at the bottom of your screen.  In other words,}

{:you NEVER need to prefix a command key with the 'O' key.}

{:CONTROL KEY:  When composing mail and in a few other places in Pine you}
{:have to use Control keys which means pressing the control key and the }
{:letter indicated at the same time.  This is usually shown with a \"^\" in}
{:front of the letter.  On some systems, certain control characters are}
{:intercepted before they get to Pine.  As a work-around, you can press}
{:the ESCAPE key twice followed by the desired key.  For example, if }
{:Control-O (^O) does not work on your system, try typing \"ESC ESC O\".}

PAGING UP/DOWN: The \"+\" and \"-\" keys are used for moving to the next
or previous page.  The space bar is a synonym for \"+\".  You may also use
Ctrl-V to page down and Ctrl-Y to page up as you do in the message
composer.  On screens with a WhereIs (search) command, W or Ctrl-W followed
by Ctrl-V will move to the bottom of the message or list, and W or Ctrl-W
followed by Ctrl-Y will move to the top of the message or list.

RETURN KEY: The return key is usually a synonym for a frequently used
command.  When viewing a message, there is currently not a default
command, so RETURN does nothing; when in the index, it is synonymous with
\"view msg\". In the key menu at the bottom of the screen, whatever is
enclosed in square brackets [] is the same as the return key.

CONTROL KEYS NOT USED BY PINE:  Most commands in Pine are single letters,
with --we hope-- some mnemonic value, but in places where Pine is expecting
text input, e.g. in the composer or at prompts for file/folder names,
control keys must be used for editing and navigation functions.

Pine has used nearly all the control keys available.  There are, however,
certain control keys that are reserved by other programs or for technical
reasons.  Pine does not use any of these keys:
                Ctrl-S    Used by Unix as \"stop output\"
                Ctrl-Q    Used by Unix as \"resume output\"
                Ctrl-]    Often used by Telnet as escape key
                Ctrl-\\   Often used by Unix as \"Abort\"
                ESC       Conflicts with sequences used for arrow keys

NOTE: by default, Pine treats Ctrl-S or Ctrl-Q (sometimes known as XOFF
and XON), as normal characters, even though Pine does not use them.
However, the printer, modem, or communication software you are using may
be configured for \"software flow control\" which means that XON/XOFF must
be treated as special characters by the operating system.  If you see
messages such as \"^X not defined for this screen\", then your system is
probably using software flow control. In this case you will need to set
the \"preserve-start-stop-characters\" feature.  If you *do* set this
feature, be advised that if you accidentally hit a Ctrl-S, Pine will
mysteriously freeze up with no warning.  In this case, try typing a Ctrl-Q
and see if that puts things right.  Printing via the \"attached-to-ansi\"
option will automatically enable software flow-control handling for the
duration of the printing.

REPAINTING THE SCREEN: Sometimes what is displayed on the screen will be
incorrect due to noise on the phone line or other causes and you will want
to repaint the whole screen to make it correct.  You can use the Ctrl-L
command to do this.  It never hurts to do it when in doubt.

---------------
| Status Line |
---------------

The top line of the screen is Pine's status line.  It will always display
the current version of Pine and will also convey information about the
status of the program.  This is where you look to find out what
collection, folder and message number is active.

If the top line says \"READONLY\" it means that the open folder (typically
your INBOX) is \"locked\" by another mail session -- most likely a more
recent session of Pine has taken the INBOX lock.

If the top line says \"CLOSED\" it means that you are trying to access a
folder on a remote mail server, and for some reason, communication with
the mail server has either been lost, or never successfully established.
This can be a result of trying to open a non-existent folder, or one
stored on an invalid or non-operational server, or it can mean that Pine
has been suspended for more that 30 minutes while accessing a remote mail
server.

{F10 Lock keyboard                      F10 ADDRESS BOOK screen :}

NOTE: The availability of certain commands (e.g. some of the options under
SETUP) is determined by Pine configuration files and system capabilities.
At some sites, certain commands may not be available due to security or
support concerns.

The \"COMPOSE MESSAGE\" command (available on MAIN MENU, FOLDER LIST,
FOLDER INDEX, and MESSAGE TEXT screens) takes you into the Pine message
composer and permits you to create and send a new message.

The \"FOLDER INDEX\" command (available on MAIN MENU, FOLDER LIST, and
MESSAGE TEXT screens) takes you to the FOLDER INDEX screen which displays
a summary caption for each message in the currently-open folder. One
message will be highlighted; this is the \"Current\" message.  The message
commands available from this screen (e.g. View, Reply, Forward, Delete,
Print, Save, etc) apply to the current message.

The \"FOLDER LIST\" command (available on MAIN MENU, FOLDER INDEX, and
MESSAGE TEXT screens) takes you to the FOLDER LIST screen which displays
the names of all your message folders and allows you to view, rename,
delete, and add folders.  You can open (view) a different folder than the
one currently open by highlighting the desired one (using the arrow keys
or their control-key equivalents) and pressing RETURN.  If you have
multiple folder collections defined (see the Help text for the FOLDER LIST
screen to learn more about Collections), you may need to press RETURN to
expand the collection and display all of the folders in it.

The \"ADDRESS BOOK\" command (available only from the MAIN MENU) takes you
to the ADDRESS BOOK management screen.  From here, your personal address
book(s) may be updated.

The \"SETUP\" command (available only from the MAIN MENU) prompts you for
one of several configuration screens, including the SETUP CONFIGURATION 
screen, by which you may activate optional Pine features.

Also available from the Main Menu, but only displayed on the Key Menus at
the bottom of the screen, are the following commands:

The \"Goto\" command (available on MAIN MENU, FOLDER LIST, FOLDER INDEX,
and MESSAGE TEXT screens) lets you jump directly to a new folder without
having to use the Folder List display. It will prompt you for the name of
the desired folder and, if you have multiple folder collections defined,
allow you to rotate through them.  However, if the folder is outside of your
defined collections, you are going to have to enter the exact folder
location using the correct syntax for a remote folder and/or the
fully-qualified path name.

The \"Release Notes\" command displays information about this version of
Pine, as well as historical and legal notes.

The \"Keyboard Lock\" command allows your Pine session to be protected
during a temporary absence from your terminal.

The \"Report Bug\" command does the obvious thing; please see section (10)
below.  This command is also available from any help screen (including
this one.)

----------------------
| Pine Configuration |
----------------------

Unless it has been administratively disabled, the Setup command on the
MAIN MENU has a \"Config\" subcommand which will allow you to modify
Pine's behavior by setting or unsetting various features, defining folder
collections, etc.  These settings are stored in your personal \"pinerc\"
configuration file, but on shared systems these settings may be
over-ridden by a system-wide control file (due to local site security or
support policies).  A global pine configuration file can also be used to
set default values for all Pine users on a particular system.

----------------
| Reading News |
----------------

BACKGROUND

Pine can read and post Internet news (NetNews or USENET) groups, using the
same commands as for mail.  If you do not already have a news state
(\"newsrc\") file, Pine will create one for you, and you can add newsgroups
to it using the \"Add\" command in the FOLDER LIST screen. Pine can use the
same newsrc as other Unix newsreaders, thus allowing you to switch between
Pine and other newsreaders; however, Pine uses the information in the file
in a slightly different way than other newsreaders.

CONFIGURATION

Pine can access news folders in any one of three different ways:

        REMOTE NNTP:  Using the Network News Transport Protocol (NNTP) to
access news on a remote news server.  In this case the newsrc file is
stored on the machine where Pine is running.  Simply specify the name of
the news server as your nntp-server:
                nntp-server      = news.nowhere.edu
If you do this (and do not explicitly set the news-collections variable),
Pine will automatically use *{{:{}news.nowhere.edu}[] for the value of
the news-collections variable.

        REMOTE IMAP:  Using the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) to
access news on a remote news server.  In this case, your newsrc file is
stored on the news server, in your home directory, so you must have an
account on the news server, but you would be running Pine on a different
machine.  The news server must be running an IMAPd server process. Specify
a remote news-collection in the SETUP CONFIGURATION:
                news-collections = News *{{:{}news.nowhere.edu}[]

        LOCAL:  Using local file access to the news database.  In this
case, your newsrc file is stored on the news server, in your home
directory, so you must have an account on the news server, and you would
be running Pine on the same machine.  Specify a local news-collection in
the SETUP CONFIGURATION:
                news-collections = News *[]

In the first two examples, the hostname \"news.nowhere.edu\" should be
replaced with the domain name of your local news server.  For Unix Pine,
these entries can be placed in either the system-wide or your personal
configuration file.

If you are a PC-Pine user, either option 1 (NNTP) or option 2 (IMAP) is
possible.  If you don't have an account on the news server, or if the news
server is not running an IMAP daemon, then you must use NNTP.  In
this case, your Unix .newsrc file can be transferred to your PC.  A good
place to put it would be in the same directory as your PINERC file, under
the name \\NEWSRC, but you can specify a different location via Pine's
Setup/Config screen.

A future version of PC-Pine will be able to access and update a newsrc
file stored on a Unix host, so that it will be possible to alternate
between PC-Pine and Unix-based newsreaders.

READING NEWS

Once defined in the .pinerc (or the global pine.conf) file, the news
folder collection can be accessed either via the FOLDER LIST screen, or
via the GOTO command.

Pine uses the same commands for manipulating news folders as for mail
folders.  This means, for example, that when you are done with a message,
you would use \"D\" to mark it as Deleted (or Dismissed, if you prefer.)
This \"mail-like\" behavior differs from that of most newsreaders, wherein
a message is implicitly dismissed after you have looked at it once. We
strongly believe that Pine should offer as much consistency as possible
between mail and news, so the mail paradigm --wherein a message does not
magically disappear without explicit action by the user-- is used for news
as well.

News folders are actually Read-Only, but the newsrc file allows Pine to
keep track of which messages you have dismissed (marked as Deleted) just
as in a regular mail folder. The difference is that, although messages
marked as Deleted will show up in the Index (just as mail messages do
until an eXpunge), you cannot expunge news messages.  However, you can use
the \"eXclude\" (X) command in order to suppress from the Folder Index
messages that are so marked.  Also, whenever you open a newsgroup folder,
messages marked Deleted are already excluded from the Index by default.
The \"unexclude\" (&) command will restore them to the Folder Index.

If you answer a message in a news folder, the index view will show the
\"A\" flag as usual; but the newsrc file has no way of storing this flag,
so it will not be preserved across sessions.  The Deleted flag is the only
one that is preserved between sessions.  If you Reply to a newsgroup
message and say you want to reply to all recipients, Pine will ask if
you want to post the message to all the newsgroups listed in the original
message.

If you would like Pine to mark more-or-less recent news messages as
\"New\", then set the \"news-approximates-new-status\" feature.  This will
cause messages after the last one you have marked as Deleted to appear
with \"N\" status in the Folder Index.  The \"N\" status often makes it
easier to distinguish later news articles from those you've previously
seen, but not yet disposed of via the \"D\" key.  Note that this is an
approximation, not an exact record of which messages you have not seen.

A frequent operation in news-reading is \"catching up\"... that is,
getting rid of all the messages in the news group so that you can \"start
fresh\".  At the moment, the easiest way to do this in Pine is via the
Select command.  You would enter the following four keystrokes: ;aad
Note that the \"enable-aggregate-command-set\" feature must be enabled
before you can use the Select command.

| Reporting Problems |
----------------------

There are now literally millions of Pine users in over 50 countries.
The Pine development team has no funding to provide support to anyone
outside of the University of Washington.  However, we certainly want Pine
to be the best tool it can be, so we do want to know about problems. We
ask that you first read the relevant help screens, if any, and then seek
assistance from your own support staff.  Once you are sure that your
difficulty is not a local configuration problem, use the \"{F11:B} Report
Bug\" command (available from any HELP screen) to let us know about it.
You may also use the Report Bug command to request local assistance
or to send a suggestion to the developers.

Please note: Pine has been adapted to several other operating systems
besides those directly supported by the University of Washington. 
Inquiries about these other ports (e.g. VMS and AmigaDOS) should be
directed to the individual or group that did the adaptation.

| Description of the FOLDER INDEX Screen  |
-------------------------------------------

The Folder Index displays the headers or summary information of each
 message in the current folder.  This is useful if you want to quickly
scan new messages, or find a particular message without having to go
through the text of each message, or to quickly get rid of junk
messages, etc.  If the list is too long to fit on one screen, you can
page up and down in the list with the {F7:-}/{F8:SPACE} commands.  The
current message is always highlighted, and its message number is shown
in the status line.  Each message line contains the following columns: 

  STATUS: The markings on the left side of the message tell you about its
status.  You may see one or more of the following codes on any given
message:

   o \"D\" for Deleted.  You have marked this message for deletion but not
         yet eXpunged the folder.
   o \"N\" for New.  You have not looked at the text of the message yet.
   o \"A\" for Answered.  Any time you reply to a message it is considered
         to be answered.
   o \"+\" for direct-to-you.  The \"+\" indicates that a message was sent
        directly to your account, your copy is not part of a cc: or a
        mailing list.
   o \"X\" for selected.  You have selected the message by using the
        \"select\" command.  (Some systems may optionally allow selected
        messages to be denoted by the index line being displayed in bold
        type.)
   o \"*\" for Important.  You have previously used the \"Flag\" command
      to mark this message as \"important\".

  NUMBER: Messages in a folder are numbered, from one through the number
of messages in the folder, to help you know where you are in the folder.

  DATE SENT: The date the message was sent.  By default, messages are
ordered by arrival time, not by date sent.  Most of the time, arrival time
and date sent (effectively departure time) are similar.  Sometimes,
however, the index will appear to be out of order because a message took a
long time in delivery.

  SENDER: The name or email address of the sender.  If you are the sender,
then the first recipient's name is shown here.  In Newsgroups, if you are
the sender and there are no email recipients, the newsgroup name will be
listed. 

  SIZE: The number in parentheses is the number of characters in the message.

  SUBJECT: As much of the message's subject line as will fit on the screen.

------------------------------
| Brief Command Explanations |
------------------------------

REPLY AND FORWARD

Replying ({F11:R}) and Forwarding ({F12:F}) are your two alternatives for
following up on the message you are reading. You would use reply if you
want to get email back to the author of the message and/or the other
people who have already seen it.  You use forward if you want somebody new
to see the message.

In the normal case, the only thing that you must supply when forwarding a
message is the name/email address of the new recipient.  Pine will
include the text of the forwarded message.  Pine will also include any
attachments to the message if you have requested them.  There is space
above the forwarded text for you to include any comments.

When replying, you usually have to answer some questions.  If the message
is to multiple people and/or specified with a Reply-To: header, then you
will have to decide who should get the reply.  You also need to decide
whether or not to include the previous message in your reply.  Some of
this is configurable.  Specifically, see the include-header-in-reply and
include-text-in-reply configuration features.

Both the Reply and Forward commands react to the full header mode toggle.
If the full header mode is on, then all the header and delivery lines are
included with the text of the message in your reply/forward.

SAVE AND EXPORT

Export ({F12:E}) and Save ({F11:S}) are the two alternatives Pine gives
you to keep a copy of the message you are reading. If you want to keep the
message within Pine's email world, use \"save\"; if you want to use the
message in another program, use \"export\".

When you save a message, it is put into an existing folder or into a new
folder in one of your existing folder collections.  The message stays in
email format and can be read by Pine again.  Pine may use a special format
for its mail folders -- never edit a Pine folder by hand or with any
program other than Pine.  The exact behavior of the save command can be
configured with the save-will-quote-leading-froms, save-will-not-delete,
and save-will-advance feature list settings.

When you use export, the message is placed in a plain text file in your
home directory or current working directory, depending on the
use-current-dir configuration setting.  In the normal case, only minimal
headers are exported with the message; however, if the full header mode is
toggled on, then complete headers are exported along with the message
text.

TAKE ADDRESS

With the Take Address command, you can extract email addresses from an
incoming message and save them in an address book.  This is an easy way
to add to your address book and avoid having to remember the email
addresses of the people who write to you.

If the message is just to you individually, then you will only need to
provide a nickname.  If the message is more complicated (with more than
one recipient or an email list involved), then you will see an address
selection screen which lets you choose the address you want to save into
your address book, or add several of them to a personal address list.

HEADER MODE

Every email message comes with some header lines that you normally don't
see.  These include anywhere from 3-20 lines added by Internet mail
transport system to record the route your message took, for diagnostic
purposes.  These are normally of no import and simply add clutter, so Pine
suppresses them from MESSAGE TEXT display.  There is, however, a way to
reveal them.

The Header Mode ({F9:H}) command is a toggle which controls Pine's
handling of these header lines.  Normally, full headers is \"off\" and you
only see a few lines about who a message is to and who it is from.  When
you press {F9:\"H\"} to turn full headers on, Pine will show you the
normal header lines as well as delivery headers, comment headers and MIME
headers.

Several different Pine commands honor the header mode -- it affects how
messages are displayed, how they appear in Forward and Reply email, how
they are printed, how they are saved, and how they are exported.  In Unix
Pine, the Pipe command is also affected.

The presence or absence of the Header Mode command is determined by the
\"enable-full-header-cmd\" feature-list option in your Pine
configuration.

EXPUNGE/EXCLUDE

Expunge/Exclude is the command Pine uses to actually remove all messages
marked for deletion.  With regular email files, expunge literally deletes
the text from the current folder.  With newsgroups or shared mailboxes,
you don't have permission to actually remove the message, so it is an
exclude -- Pine removes the message from your view of the folder even
though it is not technically gone.

GOTO

Goto is the command which lets you bypass Pine's folder selection screens
and jump directly to a new folder.  You can select any folder in the
world: one in your current collection, one in a different collection or
one in a collection you've never even used before.

Pine will help you as much as possible to narrow in on the folder you want.
However, if the folder is outside of your defined collections, you are
going to have to enter the exact folder location using the correct syntax
for a remote folder and/or fully-qualified path name.

WHEREIS

The WhereIs command lets you search the FOLDER INDEX for a word.  It scans
through whatever you see, usually the name of the author and the subject
line.  WhereIs has special features to let you \"find\" the beginning of the
index (Ctrl-Y -- first message) or the end of the index (Ctrl-V -- last
message).  WhereIs can also be used as a quick way to select messages, see
below for more information on this.  Note that WhereIs does not see the 
\"X\" in column one of Index entries for \"selected\" messages.

JUMP

This is Pine's way of allowing you to go straight to a specific message.
Just press {F7:\"J\"} and then enter the message number.  Pine can also be
configured such that typing in any number automatically jumps you to that
message (enable-jump-shortcut in the SETUP CONFIGURATION).

SORT

In Pine's generic configuration, messages are presented in the order in
which they arrive.  This default can be changed in the SETUP CONFIGURATION.
You can also re-sort the folder on demand with the sort ({F6:$}) command.
Your sorting options are: Subject, Arrival, From, Date, siZe,
OrderedSubject and Reverse.

Some of the subtleties: sorting by subject will group all messages with
the same subject together and then puts the groups in alphabetical order.
Sorting by \"ordered subject\" does a grouping intended to simulate a
\"threaded\" sort, and then presents each \"thread\" in order of the date
of the first message in the group.  Reverse simply reverses whatever the
current sort order is.

Sorting a folder does not actually rearrange the way the folder is saved,
it just re-arranges how the messages are presented to you.  This means
that Pine has to do the work of sorting every time you change sort order.
Sometimes, especially with PC-Pine or with large folders, this could take
a while.

BOUNCE

The bounce ({F10:B}) command allows you to re-send, or \"remail\", a
message, as if you were never in the loop.  It is analogous to crossing
out your address on a postal letter, writing a different address on the
envelope, and putting it into the mailbox. Bounce is used primarily to
redirect email which was sent to you in error.  Also, some owners of email
lists need the bounce command to handle list traffic.

The presence or absence of the Bounce command is determined by the
\"enable-bounce-cmd\" feature-list option in your Pine configuration. Note
that Bounce may be administratively disabled by your system manager; if it
doesn't work, please check with your local help desk before reporting a
bug.

FLAG

Flag ({F11:*}) is the command which allows users to manipulate the status
flags which appear on the left side of the FOLDER INDEX screen.  The most
common use of this is to mark a message as important. This is something of
a note to yourself to get back to that message.  You can also use the flag
command to set (or unset) the flags which indicate that a message is new,
read or answered.

The availability of the flag command is determined by the
\"enable-flag-cmd\" feature-list option in your Pine configuration. Also,
Flag may be administratively disabled by your system manager; if it
doesn't work, please check with your local help desk before reporting a
bug.

NEXT NEW (TAB) COMMAND

When you press the TAB key, Pine advances to the next \"interesting\"
message.  When you are using Pine to read email, that message is the next
message in the folder which you have not read before, or that you have
previously flagged as Important.  When reading news folders, the next
\"interesting\" message is the next one that you have not yet deleted.

SELECTING: SELECT AND WHEREIS/SELECT

Aggregate operations give you the ability to process a group of messages
at once.  Acting on multiple messages requires two steps: (1) selecting a
set of messages and then (2) applying a command to that set. The first
part is handled by the select ({F4:\";\") command.  Select allows you to
select messages based on their status (read, answered, etc.), contents
(including fielded selections on header lines) or date.  You also get
certain quick options to select a specific message or range of messages,
to select the current message or to select all messages.

After you have an initial selection, the select command changes.  It gives
you selection \"alteration\" options: unselect all, unselect current,
broaden (implements a logical OR), and narrow (implements a logical AND).
You are allowed to use select as many times as you need to get the
selected set right.

Also, the WhereIs ({F8:W}) command has a new feature (Ctrl-X) to
select all the messages which match the WhereIs search. WhereIs searches
through just the text which appears on the FOLDER INDEX.

The availability of the aggregate operations commands is determined by the
\"enable-aggregate-command-set\" feature-list option in your Pine
configuration.  Note that aggregate commands may be administratively
disabled by your system manager;  if they don't work, please check with
your local help desk before reporting a bug.

APPLY

Apply ({F5:A}) is the second step of most aggregate operations.  Apply
becomes active any time there is a defined set of selected messages.  The
following commands can be applied to a selected message set: delete,
undelete, reply, forward, print, take address, save, export, flag, and (on
Unix Pine) pipe to Unix command.

The behavior of some of these commands in an aggregate sense is not easy to
explain.  Try them out to see what they do.

ZOOM

Another action you might want to take on a set of selected messages is to
zoom in on them.  Like Apply, Zoom only becomes active when messages have
been selected.  Zoom ({F7:Z}) is a toggle command which allows you to
zoom-in (and only to see the selected messages) and zoom-out (to see all
messages in the folder).  Neither apply nor zoom removes the markings which
define the selected set; you need to use a select (\";\") command in order
to do this.

you may now delete messages from this list.  Once you choose a message,
Pine reads it in and puts you into the regular message composer.

Messages do not stay in this postponed state automatically.  If you select
a message and then want to postpone it again, use the normal postpone

| Description of the MESSAGE TEXT Screen |
------------------------------------------

The upper right corner of the view message screen displays status
information about the currently open collection and folder and about the
current message.  It shows the name of the collection in angle brackets
and then the name of the folder.  The status line also displays the number
of messages in the folder, the number of the current message and the
percentage of the current message that has been displayed on the screen.
If the message is marked for deletion \"DEL\" will appear in the upper
right as well.

NOTE: to rapidly move to the end of a message, enter W (or ^W) followed
by ^V.  Similarly, W followed by ^Y will take you to the beginning of
the message.

------------------------------
| Brief Command Explanations |
------------------------------

REPLY AND FORWARD

Replying ({F11:R}) and Forwarding ({F12:F}) are your two alternatives for
following up on the message you are reading. You would use reply if you
want to get email back to the author of the message and/or the other
people who have already seen it.  You use forward if you want somebody new
to see the message.

In the normal case, the only thing that you must supply when forwarding a
message is the name/email address of the news recipient.  Pine will
include the text of the forwarded message.  Pine will also include any
attachments to the message if you have requested them.  There is space
above the forwarded text for you to include any comments.

When replying, you usually have to answer some questions.  If the message
is to multiple people and/or specified with a Reply-To: header, then you
will have to decide who should get the reply.  You also need to decide
whether or not to include the previous message in your reply.  Some of
this is configurable.  Specifically, see the include-header-in-reply and
include-text-in-reply configuration features.

Both the Reply and Forward commands react to the full header mode toggle.
If the full header mode is on, then all the header and delivery lines are
included with the text of the message in your reply/forward.

SAVE AND EXPORT

Export ({F12:E}) and Save ({F11:S}) are the two alternatives Pine gives
you to keep a copy of the message you are reading. If you want to keep the
message within Pine's email world, use \"save\"; if you want to use the
message in another program, use \"export\".

When you save a message, it is put into an existing folder or into a new
folder in one of your existing folder collections.  The message stays in
email format and can be read by Pine again.  Pine may use a special format
for its mail folders -- never edit a Pine folder by hand or with any
program other than Pine.  The exact behavior of the save command can be
configured with the save-will-quote-leading-froms, save-will-not-delete,
and save-will-advance feature list settings.

When you use export, the message is placed in a plain text file in your
home directory or current working directory, depending on the
use-current-dir configuration setting.  In the normal case, only minimal
headers are exported with the message; however, if the full header mode is
toggled on, then complete headers are exported along with the message
text.

VIEW ATTACH

The View/Save Attachment ({F4:V}) command allows you to handle MIME
attachments on a message you have received.  Pine shows you a list of the
message attachments--you just choose the attachment you want.  You may
either view or save the selected attachment.

Because many attachments require external programs for display, there is
some system configuration that has to happen before you can actually
display attachments.  Hopefully much of that will have been done already
by your system administrator.  MIME configuration is handled with the
\"mailcap\" configuration file.  (See the release notes for more information.)

WHEREIS

The WhereIs ({F8:W}) command does a \"find in current message\" operation.
You type in a word and Pine will try and find it in the message you are
reading.  You can also use WhereIs to jump to the beginning (Ctrl-Y) or
end (Ctrl-V) of the message.

NEXT NEW (TAB) COMMAND

When you press the TAB key, Pine advances to the next \"interesting\"
message.  When you are using Pine to read email, that message is the next
message in the folder which you have not read before or which you have
previously marked \"Important\" via the Flag command.  When reading news
folders, the next \"interesting\" message is the next one which you have
not yet deleted.

TAKE ADDRESS

With the Take Address command, you can extract email addresses from an
incoming message and save them in an address book.  This is an easy way
to add to your address book and avoid having to remember the email
addresses of the people who write to you.

If the message is just to you individually, then you will only need to
provide a nickname.  If the message is more complicated (with more than
one recipient or an email list involved), then you will see an address
selection screen which lets you choose the address you want to save into
your address book, or add several of them to a personal address list.

HEADER MODE

Every email message comes with some header lines that you normally don't
see.  These include anywhere from 3-20 lines added by the Internet mail
transport system to record the route your message took, for diagnostic
purposes.  These are normally of no import and simply add clutter, so Pine
suppresses them from MESSAGE TEXT display.  There is, however, a way to
reveal them.

The Header Mode ({F9:H}) command is a toggle which controls Pine's
handling of these header lines.  Normally, full headers is \"off\" and you
only see a few lines about who a message is to and who it is from.  When
you press {F9:\"H\"} to turn full headers on, Pine will show you the
normal header lines as well as delivery headers, comment headers and MIME
headers.

Several different Pine commands honor the header mode -- it affects how
messages are displayed, how they appear in forward and reply email, how
they are printed, they are saved, and how they are exported. In Unix
Pine, the Pipe command is also affected.

The presence or absence of the Header Mode command is determined by the
\"enable-full-header-cmd\" feature-list option in your Pine
configuration.

FLAG

Flag ({F11:*}) is the command which allows users to manipulate the status
flags which appear on the left side of the FOLDER INDEX screen.  The most
common use of this is to mark a message as important. This is something of
a note to yourself to get back to that message.  You can also use the flag
command to set (or unset) the flags which indicate that a message is new,
read or answered.

The availability of the flag command is determined by the
\"enable-flag-cmd\" feature-list option in your Pine configuration. Also,
Flag may be administratively disabled by your system manager; if it
doesn't work, please check with your local help desk before reporting a
bug.

ALTERNATE CHARACTER SETS

Pine attempts to stay out of the way so that it won't prevent you from
viewing mail in any character set.  It will simply send the message to
your display device.  If the device is capable of displaying the message
as it was written it will do so.  If not, the display may be partially or
totally incorrect.  If the message is marked as being in a character set
other than \"US-ASCII\" and it is a character set that is different from
the set you have indicated with the \"character-set\" variable in your
configuration, then a warning message will be printed to your screen at
the beginning of the message display.

In all cases Pine requires that the display device can handle the
character set.  For example, most X-terminals will display the ISO-8859-1
character set if the right font is selected.  VT220's and higher also
display ISO-8859-1.  Displays for other characters sets are less common.

-----------------------------------------
| Description of the FOLDER LIST Screen |
-----------------------------------------

The purpose of the FOLDER LIST screen is to display your message folders
and allow you to \"open\" or view a new one, or manage your folders using the
Rename, Delete, and Add commands.  The status bar shows information about
the current folder.

The appearance of the Folder List depends upon your Pine configuration.
The most basic configuration will show a single list of folders, beginning
with the three distinguished folders INBOX, sent-mail, and saved-messages.
All other folders will be listed in alphabetical order.

If you or your system administrator have defined additional collections,
e.g. News, then you may see each of your collections listed with a
\"Select Here to See Expanded List\" button.  Alternatively, Pine can be
configured to always immediately display the complete list of folders in
each collection via the \"expanded-view-of-folders\" feature list option.

-----------------
| About Folders |
-----------------

What are Folders?

Folders are simply files where messages are kept.  Every message has to be
in a folder.  Most every Pine user starts out with 3 folders: an INBOX, a
folder for sent mail and a folder for saved messages.

You may create as many other folders as you wish.  They must be given
names that can be filenames on the filesystem.  On DOS that means they
must be 8-characters or less; on Unix you shouldn't use special characters
such as \"/\".  Normally PC-Pine folders are automatically given the DOS
extension \".MTX\" (which stands for Mailbox-text).  The extension is
suppressed from FOLDER LIST displays, and should not be entered when
typing a folder name at a Save or Goto prompt.  The use of the MTX extension
can be overridden by a Setup/Config option, which may be useful when
accessing saved-message folders on a Unix host via SMB or NFS.  PC-Pine
can understand the normal Unix mail folder format, but can only open
those folders READ-ONLY.

You can move messages from one folder to another by opening the original
folder and saving messages into the other folder just as you can save
message from your INBOX to any other folder.

Folders are just files in the filesystem.  However, the files which are
folders have some special formatting in them (so that Pine knows where one
message ends and another begins) and should *not* be edited outside of
Pine.  If you want copies of your messages in text files that you can edit
or otherwise manipulate, use the export command to export them from Pine.

----------------------
| Folder Collections |
----------------------

Those of you with simple mail configurations will just see a list of all the
folders you have.  The special folders for INBOX, sent mail and saved messages
will appear at the top of the list.  All others are in alphabetical order.

That model wouldn't work for Pine users with multiple collections.  If you
or your system administrator have defined more than one collection or if
you have a collection (news or otherwise) defined on your system, then you
will see each of your collections listed with a \"Select Here to See
Expanded List\" button.  Pine can be configured to always show you all
folders in all collections with the \"expanded-view-of-folders\" feature
list option in your Pine configuration.

Why have Collections?

If a Pine user only got 5 messages a day and used the same computer all the
time, then folders would be enough.  For good or bad, that is not the
case.  People who use more than one computer account need to have
different sets of folders on those different platforms.  People who have
hundreds or thousands of folders need a way to group folders together.
That is where collections come in.

Types of Collections.

A collection of folders is just a group of folders in the same directory
on the same machine.  In general, all collections of folders are equal in
Pine's eye.  However, there are some special collections:

        INCOMING FOLDERS:  Pine's \"incoming-folders\" configuration is a
special collection used to supplement your single INBOX.  All the folders
here are those that get incoming messages.  You may have multiple folders
like this because you use an external program to filter your email or
because you have multiple accounts.

        NEWS:  You can also define a collection specifically for
newsgroups.  Pine does this for you implicitly when you define a NNTP
Server in your Pine configuration.  The news collection is presented last
and Pine knows not to save messages there.

        DEFAULT COLLECTION FOR SAVES:  Perhaps the most important special
collection is the one which you specify as the first item of the
configuration for \"folder-collections\".  This is the default collection
for your saved and sent messages folders.

There is no limit to the number of collections you can have. Everyone
starts with just one collection and few people ever have more than a dozen
or so.

Defining Collections.

In the absence of any folder-collection definitions, Pine will assume a
single default folder collection, and if necessary, create the directory
\"mail\" in your Unix home directory to hold your folders.  Otherwise,
Pine will never create any directories.  However, you may create as many
mail directories as you would like using the Unix \"mkdir\" command, and
then define folder-collection entries to correspond with each one. This is
done via the Setup/Config command on the Main Menu.

----------------------
| Valid Folder Names |
----------------------

Once your folder collections are defined, you can usually refer to
folders by their simple (unqualified) name, or pick from a FOLDER LIST
display.  However, understanding the complete syntax for folder names,
both local and remote, is handy when using the Goto command and when
you are adding new folder collections via the SETUP CONFIGURATION screen.

Local folders follow the local naming rules.  For example,
\"~/mail/september-1994\" might be a reasonable folder name on Unix
and \"\\C:\\PINE\\FOLDERS\\OCT-94\" might exist on a PC.

Pine users have the option of using folders which are stored on some other
computer.  Pine accesses remote folders via IMAP (the Internet Message
Access Protocol), or in the case of news, via NNTP (the Network News
Transport Protocol).  To be able to access remote folders in Pine, the
remote host must be running the appropriate server software (imapd or
nntpd) and you must correctly specify the name of the folder to Pine,
including the domain name of the remote machine. For example,
\"{{:{}monet.art.nowhere.edu}INBOX\" is a remote folder specification, as
is \"{{:{}monet.art.nowhere.edu}~/mail/september-1994\".  As you can tell,
the name of the computer is in {{:{}} brackets followed immediately by the
name of the folder.  If, as in these examples, there is no remote access
protocol specified, then IMAP is assumed.

There are certain markings which have special meanings in folder names:
    o A \"*\" in front of the folder specification means that the folder is
      a bulletin board -- shared access and no write privileges.  Examples:
           *comp.mail.pine, *{{:{}wharhol.art.nowhere.edu}job-board
    o A folder name beginning with \"#mh/\" is an mh format folder.  Examples:
           #mh/mail/sep-1994, {{:{}rembrandt.art.nowhere.edu}#mh/mail/sep-1994

There are certain flags within remote folder names:
    o An \"/anonymous\" flag means anonymous IMAP access.  Example:
      {{:{}wharhol.art.nowhere.edu/anonymous}job-board
    o A \"/nntp\" flag means NNTP protocol access.  It cannot be used with
      the /anonymous flag.  Example:
           *{{:{}news.nowhere.edu/nntp}comp.mail.pine

Note that \"INBOX\" has special meaning in both local and remote folder
specifications.  The name INBOX refers to your \"principal incoming
message folder\" and will be mapped to the actual file name used for your
INBOX on any given host.  Therefore, a name like
\"{{:{}xxx.art.nowhere.edu}INBOX\" refers to whatever file is used to
store incoming mail for you on that particular host.

------------------------------------------
| Description of the Address Book Screen |
------------------------------------------

This screen lets you edit any and all entries in your address book.  It
also acts as a short-cut for composing messages to people in the address
book.  When, from this screen, you press {F11:\"C\"} for ComposeTo, the
message starts \"pre-addressed\" to whatever address book entry is
currently selected.

If you have more than one address book defined for yourself or if your
system has a site-wide address book defined, you may see a list of address
books and a \"Select Here to See Expanded List\" button for each of them.
Alternatively, Pine can be configured to immediately display all the
entries in each address book via the \"expanded-view-of-addressbooks\"
feature list option in your Pine configuration.

Pine's address book helps you keep a list of addresses you send mail to so
you do not have to remember addresses that are often complex.  Each entry
in the address book has five fields, all of them optional.  The three
elements which are usually visible on the ADDRESS BOOK display, are:

        NICKNAME: A short easy-to-remember label to identify the entry.
        This is what you type in as you are addressing the message in the
        composer.  If there is a matching entry in your address book(s),
        Pine will extract the corresponding FullName and Address fields to
        generate the actual address for your message.

        FULLNAME: A longer field where you can put the full name of the
        person or organization.  Usually the full names are put in last
        name first so they sort nicely in alphabetical order.  Whatever
        you put as the name here will appear on the message when it is
        finally delivered.

        ADDRESS: This is the actual email address itself.  This must be
        a valid Internet address that conforms to the Internet message
        header standard, RFC-822.  (There is more information on email
        addresses a little later in this section.)

The two fields which aren't usually visible are:

        FCC: The name of the folder you would like a copy of any outgoing
        message to this address to be saved in.  If this field is set, and
        this address is the first one in the message's To: header, then
        Pine will use this folder name for the FCC in lieu of the normal
        FCC folder name.

        COMMENTS: This field contains arbitrary text for your convenience.

Due to screen width limitations, these last two fields do not show up in
the normal ADDRESS BOOK display.  You may select the \"View/Edit\" command to
view or modify them.  You may use the configuration variable
\"addressbook-formats\" to add these fields to your ADDRESS BOOK display,
or to modify the format of the display.

---------------------------
| Sorting the Address book |
---------------------------

By default, address book entries are sorted alphabetically on the full
name with distribution lists sorted to the end.  Sorting can be changed by
resetting the address book sort rule in the Pine SETUP CONFIGURATION screen
--assuming you have \"write\" permission for the address book file.

Unlike the sorting of folders (which only changes presentation), sorting an
address book actually changes the file as it is kept on the computer.  For
this reason you may not be able to sort a shared or system-wide address
book.

----------------------
| Distribution Lists |
----------------------

Pine entries can be simple cases of aliases (a single nickname is linked
to a single email address) or distribution lists (a single nickname
pointing at more than one email address).  Each distribution list has a
nickname, a full name and a list of addresses.  The addresses may be
actual addresses or they may be other nicknames in your address book.
They may even refer to other distribution lists.  The command to create a
new distribution list is {F10:\"A\"}.  To add entries to an existing list
use the View/Edit ({F4:\"V\"}) command.  Delete ({F11:\"D\"}) will delete
a single address from the list if the cursor is placed on the address;
it will delete the entire distribution list if the cursor is on the
nickname/fullname line.  View/Edit may also be used to delete addresses
from a list.

Address field entries in distribution lists may take any one of three
forms: a nickname existing in any of the defined address books, a normal
address of the form \"jsmith@art.nowhere.edu\", or a complete
fullname/address combination, e.g. \"John Smith
<jsmith@art.nowhere.edu>\".

Distribution lists in Pine address books can only be used by the person or
people who have access to that address book.  They are not usually used to
implement discussion groups, but can be used to facilitate small
discussion groups if all the participants have access to the same shared
address book.

--------------------
| FCC and Comments |
--------------------

As mentioned above, each entry in the address book also has two other optional
fields, fcc and comments.  The command to look at or edit either of these
is the same View/Edit command used for all of the fields ({F4:\"V\"}).  The
comments field is just for your own use.  The fcc field overrides the
default fcc if this address is the first one on the To line.  The WhereIs
command may be used to search for particular strings in the address book,
including fields which are not visible (like comment and fcc by default).

-------------------------------------------------
| Exporting and Forwarding Address book entries |
-------------------------------------------------

When you use the Export ({F11:\"X\"}) command, the currently highlighted
address book entry is placed in a plain text file in your home directory
or current working directory, depending on the use-current-dir
configuration setting.

When you use the Forward ({F12:\"F\"}) command, the currently highlighted
address book entry is placed in a special attachment (which is only
understood by Pine) and you are put into the composer.  You can fill in
some comments in the body of the message, if you'd like, and send it to
somebody else who uses Pine.  The recipient may use the TakeAddr command
on that message to insert the address book entry you sent in their own
address book.

-------------------------------------------
| Multiple and/or Site-Wide Address books |
-------------------------------------------

You may have more than one personal address book.  In addition, there may
be one or more global address books.  This capability allows you to have
multiple personal address books (some of which may be shared) and it also
allows system administrators to implement site-wide address books that
contain entries for users on multiple machines within the organization.

Searching.  If you enter a nickname when composing a message, your
personal address books will be searched through in order, and then the
global address book(s) searched. If more than one address book has an entry
for the nickname, Pine uses the first one that it finds, so an entry in
your personal address book would override a global address book entry. If
after searching all the address books there is still no match, (Unix) Pine
then searches the local host password file on the assumption that you have
entered a local user name rather than an address book nickname.

Defining.  You define multiple personal address books via the
\"address-book\" option in the SETUP CONFIGURATION screen.  You can add as
many as you like. System administrators may specify a site-wide address
book by defining the \"global-address-book\" variable in the system-wide
Pine configuration file.  You may override this definition using the
\"global-address-book\" option in the SETUP CONFIGURATION screen.

Creating and updating.  Personal address books are normally created empty
and populated by explicit additions from within Pine, e.g. via the
TakeAddr command. Unlike personal address books, global address books may
not be modified/updated from within Pine; that is, they are Read-Only.
Thus, global address books are created, populated and updated outside of
Pine. They might be hand-edited, generated by a program from another
database, or by copying an existing address book.  See the Pine Technical
Notes document (included in the Pine distribution) for more information on
this.

Accessing.  Address books must be accessible via normal file access
routines on the machine where Pine is running.  That is, Pine does not yet
have the ability to access address books on remote systems, except via
low-level file access protocols such as NFS or SMB.  (It is understood
that this limits the utility of global address books for PC-Pine users.)

While global address books are explicitly intended to be shared, there is
nothing to prevent you from sharing a personal address book with other
Pine users. This might be useful in the case of a small workgroup.
However, it is recommended that updates to shared personal address books
be done when other Pine users are not accessing the address book. Pine
does not do any file-locking to manage concurrent updates to the
addressbook, but it does check to see if the file has been modified before
making any changes.  Consequently, inadvertent concurrent updates will
only cause other Pine users to have to restart their address book
operation, which will cause Pine to re-open the updated file.

-------------------------
| Valid Email Addresses |
-------------------------

When you enter an email address into the address field of your address
book you are giving Pine an address that it must be able to actually
reach.  The address you enter here must be a valid address which is
reachable from your site.  If it is not, you will get an error message
after sending the message.

A valid email address on the Internet has a user name, an \"@\" sign and
then a domain.  For example, jsmith@art.nowhere.edu is the email address
of a person with the username \"jsmith\" who has an account with
\"art.nowhere.edu\".  The number of segments on the right of the \"@\"
sign can vary depending on how the address is structured for the
particular host.

If you are sending to someone on the same system as you are, you can leave
the \"@\" and all the information to its right off of the address, and
Pine will fill it in automatically.  Sometimes you can also abbreviate the
right part of the address if you are at the same domain.  When sending
messages across gateways to other networks, the addresses get more
complicated.  Ask your local consultants for the correct syntax from your
site to the network you are trying to reach.

| Description of the Take Address Screen |
------------------------------------------

This screen is designed to let you select one or more address/name
combinations from the current message into your address book.  The cursor
is initially placed on the line with the message author.  Other lines
include the names of people and/or mailing lists who also received the
message.  Other people \"involved\" in the message (e.g. the person named as
Reply-To:) are also listed here.

The simple case is adding a new, single entry into your address book. To
do this, simply highlight the correct line and press {F4:\"T\"}.  To
create a new list or add to an existing list, switch the screen display
into List Mode by pressing {F12:\"L\"}.  In List Mode, you select the
group of addresses you wish to manipulate by marking them with an \"X\".
The Set/Unset ({F9:\"X\"}) command will turn the \"X\" on for the
highlighted address if it was off or turn it off if it was previously on.
The SetAll command will select all of the addresses, and the UnSetAll
command will turn off all the selections.  Once you've gotten the
selection the way you want it, you may create a new list by pressing
{F4:\"T\"}.

In both the simple and list cases, after choosing to take the address,
you will be asked for the nickname of the entry.  Typing in a new name
creates the new entry/list.  Entering an existing nickname will replace
the entry (simple case) or add to the list (list case).  Alternatively,
you can press Ctrl-T at the nickname prompt and select an existing
nickname from your address book.

You will normally start in Single Mode, unless you used the Apply command
to startup the TakeAddr screen, in which case you will start in List Mode.
You may switch between the two modes at any time.  If you've already
selected several addresses in List Mode, those will be remembered when you
switch to Single Mode and then back to List Mode.  The set of addresses
that are pre-selected when you start in List Mode are the From addresses
of all of the messages you are operating on.  You may, of course, easily
erase those selections with the UnSetAll command.

If you have more than one writable address book, you will be prompted for
the name of the address book you wish to add the new entry to before
anything else. You can use ^N and ^P to choose among the defined address
books, or type in the address book name.

                     GETTING HELP IN PINE

Pine offers specific help for every screen via the \"?\" or \"^G\"
keys.  (The Control-G key is used in contexts where \"?\" would be
mistaken as text being entered.)

The MAIN MENU help (\"?\") provides a general overview of Pine, as
well as information specific to that screen.  There is also a
\"Release Notes\" command available from the MAIN MENU.

Although this version of Pine is for Microsoft Windows, it is not a
full \"Graphical User Interface\" application.  However, it does
offer limited mouse support.  You can click on commands at the bottom
of the screen, and you can click or double-click on items on most
screens to select or view them.

In the mail index, clicking with the right mouse button on an item
will display that item in a separate window.  Control-Click will
always display the item in a new separate window.

In the composer message body you can select text with the mouse.
Press the mouse button down, drag across the text you want to select,
lift the mouse button.  If you move the mouse above the top or below
the bottom of the window the message text will scroll.  Shift-Click
will extend an existing selection.  You can Cut or Copy the selected
text in the composer message body.

In all other screens you can select any text visible on the screen
with the mouse, but can only Copy the selected text.

NOTE: The presence or absence of the following commands is determined by
\"feature-list\" options in your Pine configuration.  Also, some of these
commands may be administratively disabled by your system manager; if they
don't work, please check with your local help desk before reporting a bug.
        o Suspend (suspends Pine and gives a system prompt)
        o Alternate editor (allows you to compose with your own editor)

HINT: To move rapidly to the bottom of a message you are composing,
enter ^W^V.  To go to the top, ^W^Y.  These can be used in conjunction

The \"Alternate Editor\" and \"Spell Check\" commands are not available in
PC-Pine.

Pine does not use the following keys:  Ctrl-S, Ctrl-Q, Ctrl-], Ctrl-\\, ESC

NOTE: by default, Pine treats Ctrl-S or Ctrl-Q (sometimes known as XOFF
and XON), as normal characters, even though Pine does not use them except
during attached-to-ansi printing. However, the modem, or communication
software you are using may be configured for \"software flow control\"
which means that XON/XOFF must be treated as special characters by the
operating system.  If you see messages such as \"^X not defined for this
screen\", then your system is probably using software flow control. In
this case you will need to set the \"preserve-start-stop-characters\"
feature.  If you *do* set this feature, be advised that if you
accidentally hit a Ctrl-S, Pine will mysteriously freeze up with no
warning.  In this case, try typing a Ctrl-Q and see if that puts things
right.

---------------------------
| Description of Composer |
---------------------------

Pine has a built-in editing program which allows you to compose messages
without having to leave Pine.  The editor is designed to be very simple to
use so that you can get started writing email right away.

Messages are usually just text, about 80 columns wide.  Using upper and
lower case is encouraged.  On some systems the size limit of the message
is about 100,000 characters, which is about 2,000 lines.  You can include
punctuation and special characters found on most keyboards, but you can't
include characters with diacritical marks and certain special symbols.

Text automatically wraps as you type past the end of a line so you do not
have to hit return.  Using the {F4:\"Ctrl-J\"} command, you can also
reformat text explicitly, perhaps after you have deleted some text.

You can include other text files with the {F5.:\"Ctrl-R\".} You will be
prompted for the file name of the file.

------------------------------
| Brief Command Explanations |
------------------------------

MARK, CUT, AND PASTE

You can define a \"block\" of text, which can subsequently be deleted or
copied as a unit, by setting a mark at the start of the block (Ctrl-^) and
then moving the cursor to the end of the desired text block.  You can then
\"cut\" the block out ({F9:Ctrl-K}), move the cursor, and \"paste\" it
({F10:Ctrl-U}) in the new location.  Also, you can paste more than once,
allowing you to use this feature to copy a block of text.

If you press {F9:Ctrl-K} without having marked anything, Pine will delete
a single line.  If you delete a group of lines together, Pine keeps them
in the same buffer, so {F10:Ctrl-U} will restore them as a block.  About
terminology:  Mark is shown as \"^^\".  The first \"^\" means you should
hold down the \"Control\" key on your keyboard.  The second \"^\" means
\"type the character ^\".

JUSTIFY ({F4:Ctrl-J})

The justify command reformats the text in the paragraph the cursor is in.
Paragraphs are separated by one blank line or a line beginning with a space.
This is useful when you have been editing a paragraph and the lines become
uneven.  The text is left aligned or justified and the right is ragged.  If
the text is already justified as typed with auto-wrap, no justification will
be done.

When composing a reply containing included text, the justify command will
reformat text to the right of the reply-indent-string (\"> \" by default),
adding or removing indented lines as needed.  Paragraphs are separated by a
blank line, a line containing only the reply-indent-string, or a line
containing the indent string and one or more blank spaces.  Included text
that was previously indented (or \"quoted\") is not preserved.

READ FILE ({F5:Ctrl-R})

This will allow you to copy in text from an existing file. You will be
prompted for the name of a file to be inserted into the message.  The file
name is relative to your home directory or must be a full path name on
your system.  The file will be inserted where the cursor is located.  *The
file to be read must be on the same system as Pine.* If you use Pine on a
Unix machine but have files on a PC or MAC, the files must be transferred
to the system Pine is running on before they can be read.  Please ask your
local computer support people about the correct way to transfer a file to 
your Pine system.

WHEREIS ({F6:Ctrl-W})

WhereIs searches the message body part of your composition and moves the
cursor to the first occurrence of the match string appearing after the
location of the cursor.  The search will wrap to the beginning of the
message when it no longer finds matches in the remainder of the message.

To search for the same string a second time, press {F12:^W} to begin search
and then just press RETURN to accept the previous search string shown in
square brackets rather than entering a new search string.

WhereIs can \"search\" for the first line or last line of a message -- this
means that WhereIs is a jump-to-top and jump-to-bottom feature, too.

POSTPONE ({F11:Ctrl-O})

Temporarily stop working on the current message so you may read other
messages or compose another message.  When you want to resume a message
later, start to compose and answer \"yes\" to the \"Continue postponed
composition?\" question.  You may postpone as many messages as you like.

SPELL CHECK ({F12:Ctrl-T})

Pine can call an external spell checking program to look over the message
you are composing.  By default, Pine uses the simple Unix spell checker.
There are no suggested alternative spellings, but Pine will show you the
\"incorrect\" word and let you fix it or move on.  If a word is misspelled
more than once, then you will be prompted to confirm the correction of
each occurrence of it.  Lines beginning with \">\" ( included messages)
will not be checked.  There is no spell check feature with PC-Pine.

SEND ({F2:Ctrl-X})

Before sending a message, Pine will ask you to confirm that you want the
message to go out.  At that confirmation stage, Pine moves the composer
back to the top so that you can verify that the right people are getting
the message.  After confirmation, the message is sent and copied to the
FCC folder (if any).

====== h_composer_browse =====

Use this to browse files, perhaps created by some other application.  The
file name given can be a file in your home directory, an absolute file
path name for your system, or a file path relative to your home directory.
No wild card characters may be used.  In Unix Pine, you may use \"~\" to
refer to your home directory or \"~user\" to refer to another's home
directory.  The file must reside on the system running Pine.

If the \"use-current-dir\" feature is set, names are relative to your
current directory at the time you started Pine, rather than to your
home directory.

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_composer_ins =====

Use this function to insert a text file into your message. The file name
given can be a file in your home directory, an absolute file path name for
your system, or a file path relative to your home directory.  No wild card
characters may be used.  In Unix Pine, you may use \"~\" to refer to your
home directory or \"~user\" to refer to another's home directory.  The

The search will wrap to the beginning of the message when it no longer
finds matches in the remainder of the message.

To search for the same string a second time, press {F12:Ctrl-W} to begin
search and then just press RETURN to accept the previous search string

======= h_composer_to ====

Topics:
 o The \"To:\" field
 o Email Address Format
 o Message Header Commands

-------------------
| The \"To:\" field |
-------------------

The address you enter here must be a valid address which is reachable
from your site.  If it is not, you will get an error message after sending
the message.

------------------------
| Email Address Format |
------------------------

You may enter a full name and address, a local address that Pine will
complete for you, the nickname of someone in an address book, or a local
mail alias defined by your system administrator.  When you move the cursor
out of this field, the nicknames will be expanded to the addresses in your
address book, and the local names will be expanded to include the actual
user name.  You may enter as many addresses as you wish, but they must be
separated by commas.  You can move around this and other header fields
with the arrow keys and use many of the usual composer editing keys.

A valid email address on the Internet has a username, an \"@\" sign and
then a domain.  For example, jsmith@art.nowhere.edu is the email address
of a person with the username \"jsmith\" who has an account with
\"art.nowhere.edu\".  The number of segments on the right of the \"@\"
sign can vary depending on how the address is structured for the
particular host.

If you are sending to someone on the same system as you are, you can leave
the \"@\" and all the information to its right off of the address, and
Pine will fill it in automatically.  Sometimes you can also abbreviate the
right part of the address if you are at the same domain.  When sending
messages across gateways to other networks, the addresses get more
complicated.  Ask your local consultants for the correct syntax from your
site to the network you are trying to reach.

======= h_composer_cc ====

The Cc: field is just like the To: field, except it is used for addressees
that you wish to send a carbon copy to.  That is, the message is not directly
addressed to these recipients, but you wanted them to see the message.  The
only difference the recipients see is that their name is in the Cc: field,
rather than the To: field.

For information on email address formats or help with message header editing
commands, check the Help for the To: header.

<End of help on this topic>
======= h_composer_bcc ====

The \"Bcc:\" (Blind carbon copy) header is used when you wish to send a 
copy of the message to one or more people whose addresses you do not
wish disclosed, either to reduce clutter or for confidentiality.

The format of the Bcc: field is just the same as the To: and Cc: fields in
the way the addresses are entered.  The recipients listed here will
receive a copy of the message, but --assuming your site's mail transport
software is properly configured-- their addresses will not show up in the
headers of the message, as delivered to all of the recipients.  The To:
and Cc:  recipients will not know a copy was sent to the Bcc: recipients.

Note: if there is no To: or Cc: or Lcc: address in the message, Pine
will automatically generate and place in the To: field a pseudo-address of 
  \"Undisclosed recipients: ;\"
or whatever string has been specified in the \"empty-header-message\"
variable.

The reason for this is to avoid embarrassment caused by some Internet
mail transfer software that interprets a \"missing\" To: header as 
an error and replaces it with an Apparently-to: header that may contain
the addresses you entered on the Bcc: line.  In addition, it may be
less disconcerting to Bcc: recipients to see *something* in the To: field.

You can manipulate what text ends up on the (originally) empty To:
field.  Just remember to put a colon and semicolon at the end of the
field, which is a special notation denoting that it is not a real address.

For information on email address formats or help with message header editing
commands, check the Help for the To: header.

<End of help on this topic>
======= h_composer_lcc ====

The \"Lcc\" (List carbon copy) header is intended to be used when
you wish to send a message to a list of people but avoid having all
of their addresses visible, in order to reduce clutter when the
message is received.
 
It is similar to the \"Bcc\" (Blind carbon copy) header in that individual
addressees are hidden, but Lcc is designed to work specifically with
distribution lists you have created in your Pine address book.  Placing
the nickname of the list on the Lcc line will result in the full name of
your Pine Address Book list being placed on the To: line of the message,
using a special notation that distinguishes it from a real address. You
must leave the To: line blank for your list name to appear there.
 
For example, if you have this list entered in your Address Book:
 
        largo         Key Largo List       DISTRIBUTION LIST:
                                           bogie@mgm.com
                                           lauren@mgm.com
                                           walter@mgm.com
 
And you enter \"largo\" on the Lcc: line while composing a message, the
result is:
 
        To      : Key Largo List: ;
        Cc      :
        Bcc     :
        Fcc     : sent-mail
        Lcc     : Key Largo List <bogie@mgm.com>,
                  lauren@mgm.com,
                  walter@mgm.com
        Subject :
 
Each recipient listed on the Lcc: line receives a copy of the message
without their address being visible (as though they were listed on the
Bcc: line). The colon-semicolon notation used to put the full-name of the
list on the To: line is a special address format that doesn't specify any
actual addressees, but does give some information to the recipients of the
message.

Note: if after entering an LCC, you delete the list name that is placed
on the To: line, then recipients will see To: Undisclosed recipients: ;
(or whatever string is defined in the empty-header-message variable)
just as in the BCC case.

editing commands, check the Help for the To: header.
 
<End of help on this topic>
======= h_composer_from =======

This header carries your return address.  It is the address toward which
replies (and often, future unrelated correspondence) will be directed,
unless you have defined an optional \"Reply-To:\" header.  Make sure this
address is correct.

For information on email address formats or help with message header editing
commands, check the Help for the To: header.

<End of help on this topic>
======= h_composer_reply_to =======

Most people should not need this header. The Reply-To: header is used in
cases where you would like replies to your messages to be directed to an
address other than your normal \"From:\" address.  This is atypical, but
can happen when you use multiple machines and do not have the same account
name on each one, or when you wish to direct certain replies to accounts
or folders designated for specific classes of correspondence.

For information on email address formats or help with message header editing
commands, check the Help for the To: header.

<End of help on this topic>
======= h_composer_custom_addr ====

This is a customized header, i.e. not one that is part of Pine's normal
set of Compose headers.

For information on email address formats or help with message header editing
commands, check the Help for the To: header.

<End of help on this topic>
======= h_composer_custom_free ====

This is a customized header, i.e. not one that is part of Pine's normal
set of Compose headers.

This field consists of arbitrary text.

For help with message header editing commands, check the Help for the
To: header.

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_composer_news =====

Use the Newsgroups line to specify any and all USENET newsgroups to which
your message should be posted.  When composing a message from scratch, this
line may be hidden.  If so, just press the rich headers command
({F5:Ctrl-R}) to make it visible.

Be aware that when you post to a newsgroup thousands of people will be reading
your message.  Also, you or your system manager must have defined a \"nntp-
server\" in your Pine configuration in order for you to be able to post.

For help with message header editing commands, check the Help for the
To: header.

<End of help on this topic>
======= h_composer_fcc ====

The FCC (File Carbon Copy) specifies the folder used to keep a copy of
each outgoing message.  The default value can be configured with the
\"default-fcc\" and \"fcc-name-rule\" options.  You can change or remove
the file carbon copy on any message you send by editing the FCC header.

You may type ^T to get a list of all your folders and select one to use as
the FCC for this message.

For help with message header editing commands, check the Help for the
To: header.

<End of help on this topic>
======= h_composer_subject ====

The subject header provides a place to enter a few words that summarize
the topic of the message you are sending.  You may leave this line blank,
but it is considered a courtesy to use a meaningful subject.

For help with message header editing commands, check the Help for the
To: header.

<End of help on this topic>
======= h_composer_attachment ====

This field is where you specify what file or files you'd like attached to
the message you are composing.  Those files must reside on the machine
running Pine. If your file is on a PC or Mac and you run Pine with an
account on a Unix machine, you'll have to transfer it before attaching it.
Contact local computer support people for assistance with transferring.

Pine uses MIME encoding for attachments, so binaries and files of any
length can safely be delivered to any MIME-capable mail reading program.
If you send an attachment to someone who does not have a MIME-capable mail
reading program yet, then the main message text will be readable, but
attachments (even attachments which are just plain text) are not.

Typing the filename on the Attchmnt: line achieves the same
result as using the {F6:Ctrl-J} command.

If you Forward a message with attachments, you may delete them from your
Forwarded message by editing the Attchmnt header line.

To: header.

\"feature-list\" options in your Pine configuration.  Also, some of these
commands may be administratively disabled by your system manager; if they
don't work, please check with your local help desk before reporting a bug.

        o Suspend (suspends Pine and gives a system prompt)
        o Alternate editor (allows you to compose with your own editor)

The \"Alternate Editor\" and \"Spell Check\" commands are not available in
PC-Pine.

Pine does not use the following keys:  Ctrl-S, Ctrl-Q, Ctrl-], Ctrl-\\, ESC

NOTE: by default, Pine treats Ctrl-S or Ctrl-Q (sometimes known as XOFF
and XON), as normal characters, even though Pine does not use them.
However, the printer, modem, or communication software you are using may
be configured for \"software flow control\" which means that XON/XOFF must
be treated as special characters by the operating system.  If you see
messages such as \"^X not defined for this screen\", or if messages
printed via the \"attached-to-ansi\" option are missing pieces, then your
system is probably using software flow control. In this case you will need
to set the \"preserve-start-stop-characters\" feature.  If you *do* set
this feature, be advised that if you accidentally hit a Ctrl-S, Pine will
mysteriously freeze up with no warning.  In this case, try typing a Ctrl-Q
and see if that puts things right.

======= h_composer_abook_nick =======

This is a short nickname for this address book entry.  If it is used in

======= h_composer_abook_full =======

This is the full name field for this entry.  If this is going to be a
distribution list (more than one address), it should be a descriptive
phrase describing the list.  It will be included in the mail header if you
put the list in the To: or CC: field, or in the To: line if you put the
list in the Lcc: field.  It's OK to leave this field blank (and OK to
leave any of the other fields blank, too).  If this address book entry is
going to be a simple entry with just one address, then this field is the
person's name.  When you send mail to this entry, this is the field to the
left of the brackets.  That is, it is the most readable part of the 
address.  For example, in the sample address:

       John Doe <jdoe@some.domain>

\"John Doe\" is the full name field.  If you are sorting your address book
with one of the options that uses full names, then it might be useful to
enter the full name as \"Last, First\", for example:

       Doe, John

so that it will be sorted using Doe instead of John.  This will be changed
back into John Doe when you use it.

Nickname: field.

<End of help on this topic>
======= h_composer_abook_fcc =======

If this entry is the first one in the To: line of an outgoing message,
this field will be used for the Fcc (File Carbon Copy) instead of whatever

chosen). 

For help with editing and navigation commands, check the Help for the
Nickname: field.

<End of help on this topic>
======= h_composer_abook_comment =======

This is just a comment to help you remember what this entry is.  The WhereIs
command searches comments so that it is easier to find an entry with a comment
you know about attached to it.  This field is not used in the outgoing message.

For help with editing and navigation commands, check the Help for the
Nickname: field.

<End of help on this topic>
======= h_composer_abook_addrs =======

This is a list of addresses to send to when sending to this address book
entry.  Each member of the list may be an address or another nickname from
any of your address books.  If it is an address, it is OK to include the
full name field as well as the electronic address portion of that address.
For example, the following are all legitimate entries in this field:

     john               (a nickname in your address book)
     jdoe@some.domain
     John Doe <jdoe@some.domain>

The addresses should be listed separated by commas, just like you would
enter them from the composer.

The only difference between a distribution list and a simple entry with a
single address, is that a distribution list has more than one address   
listed in the Addresses: field, whereas a simple personal entry has just  
one address.

For individual address book entries, if there is a full name in the
Fullname: field (filling in the Fullname: field is not required), it is
used.  If the full name is specified in the Address: field and not in the
Fullname: field, then the full name from the Address: field is used.

If you type the nickname of a distribution list from one of your address 
books in the Lcc: field, then the full name of that list is used in the  
To: field.  If you put a list in the To: or Cc: fields, that list will be
expanded into all of its addresses.  If the list has a full name, then
that will appear at the beginning of the addresses.

Sewing Club <john@somewhere>, nancy@something.else, Sal <sal@here.there>

If the first address in the distribution list also has a full name, then
the list full name and that full name are combined into something like the
following:

Sewing Club -- John Smith <john@somewhere>

If you specify a list via Lcc, the full name is used in the To: line.  If
you specify a list in the To: or Cc: fields, then it uses the same method
as for individual entries for filling in the full name.

For help with editing and navigation commands, check the Help for the
Nickname: field.

======= h_flag_important =======

Th \"Important\" flag, indicated by an asterisk in Pine's Folder Index
screen, can only be set by the user, and is intended to be used in
whatever fashion makes sense to you.  You are the only one that can set or
clear it. 

<End of help on this topic>
======= h_flag_new =======

Th \"New\" flag, indicated by the letter 'N' in Pine's Folder Index screen,
is automatically set when messages are delivered to your Inbox (or other
folder specified outside of Pine).  Likewise, it is cleared automatically
the first time you read the message it is associated with.

Sometimes it's helpful in prioritizing your mail.  For example, perhaps
a message isn't weighty enough to assign it an \"Important\" flag, but
you'd like to be reminded of it next time you read mail.  This can be done
easily by explicitly resetting the \"New\" flag.

<End of help on this topic>
======= h_flag_answered =======

The \"Answered\" flag, indicated by the letter 'A' in Pine's Folder Index
screen, is automatically set when you reply to a message.  This flag is not
automatically cleared.

NOTE: Technical limitations prevent the current version of Pine from
being able to automatically flag a message whose reply has been postponed
as \"Answered\".  This will be fixed in a future release.

<End of help on this topic>
======= h_flag_deleted =======

The \"Deleted\" flag, indicated by the letter 'D' in Pine's Folder Index
screen, is set when you use the \"D Delete\" command.  It is cleared
when you use the \"U Undelete\" command.

However, there can be other actions implicit in the \"D Delete\" command,
such as advancing to the next message, that may be momentarily undesirable.
For this reason, it's sometimes useful to set or clear the \"Deleted\" flag
explicitly.

====== h_config_pers_name ======
        OPTION: Personal-Name

This value is used to determine the full name part of the \"From\" address

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_pruned_folders ======
        OPTION: Pruned-folders

This variable allows you to define a list of one or more folders that
Pine will offer to prune for you in the same way it automatically offers
to prune your \"sent-mail\" folder each month.

That is, once a month for each folder listed, Pine will offer to move
the contents of the folder to a new folder of the same name but with
the previous month's date appended.  Pine will then look for any such
date-appended folder names created for a previous month, and offer each
one it finds for deletion.

If you decline the first offer, no mail is moved and no new folder is
created.

Folders listed are assumed to exist, and the archive folders will be created,
in the first collection defined by the \"folder-collections\" variable.

====== h_config_upload_cmd ======
        OPTION: Upload-command
 
This option affects the behavior of the Composer's \"Read File\" (^R in the
message body) and \"Attach File\" (^J in the header) commands.  It specifies
a Unix program name, and any necessary command line arguments, that Pine can
use to transfer files from your personal computer into messages that you are
composing.

Note: this facility is intended for use with serial line transfer 
protocols, such as kermit, xmodem, or zmodem.  It is *not* intended
to work with TCP/IP file transfer programs such as ftp.

If a program is specified, the commands listed above are modified to offer a
subcommand (^Y) to activate the transfer.  Obviously, the Unix program
specified here must match the transfer program or protocol available on the
personal computer.

Pine expects to exchange uploaded data via a file on your Unix system.  When
the specified upload program finishes, Pine expects the uploaded data to be
contained in this file.

When upload is invoked via the \"Read File\" subcommand, Pine generates a
temporary file name that it will pass to the specified Unix program.  Pine
will read the resulting uploaded text from this file and then delete it when
the upload command is finished.

When upload is invoked via the \"Attach File\" subcommand, Pine will prompt
you for the name of the file that is to contain the uploaded information that
it is to attach.  Pine will attach this file to the composition, but will
*not* delete this file after the upload command is finished.

The special token \"_FILE_\" may be included among the Unix program's command
line arguments.  Pine will replace this symbol with the name of the file
being used to exchange the uploaded information.  This token allows you to
position the file name where it is required in the Unix program's command
line arguments.

If the \"_FILE_\" token is not present in the specified command, the
temporary file's name is automatically appended to the specified Unix
program.  In other words, you don't need to use \"_FILE_\" if it is the
*last* command line argument.

====== h_config_upload_prefix ======
        OPTION: Upload-command-prefix

This option is used in conjunction with the Upload-command option.
It defines text to be written to the terminal emulator (via standard output)
immediately prior to starting upload command.  This is useful for
integrated serial line file transfer agents that permit command passing
(e.g., Kermit's APC method).

The special token \"_FILE_\" may be included in the string specification.
That symbol will be replaced with the (Pine-created) name of the temporary
file in which Pine will expect to find the uploaded file.

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_download_cmd ======
        OPTION: Download-command

This option affects the behavior of the Export command.  It specifies a Unix
program name, and any necessary command line arguments, that Pine can use to
transfer the exported message to your personal computer's disk.

Note: this facility is intended for use with serial line transfer 
protocols, such as kermit, xmodem, or zmodem.  It is *not* intended
to work with TCP/IP file transfer programs such as ftp.

If a program is specified, the Export command is modified to offer a
subcommand (^V) to activate the transfer (in lieu of saving it to your home
directory on the machine where Pine is running).  Obviously, the Unix program
specified here must match the transfer program or protocol available on the
personal computer.

When this subcommand is selected and before Pine invokes the specified Unix
program, Pine will create a temporary file containing the text of the
exported message.  Pine uses this file to pass the exported message text to
the specified Unix program.

The special token \"_FILE_\" may be included among the Unix program's command
line arguments.  Pine will replace this symbol with the temporary file's name
before executing the Unix program.  This token allows you to position the
file name where it is required in the Unix program's command line arguments.

If the \"_FILE_\" token is not present in the specified command, the
temporary file's name is automatically appended to the specified Unix
program.  In other words, you don't need to use \"_FILE_\" if it is the
*last* command line argument.

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_download_prefix ======
        OPTION: Download-command-prefix

This option is used in conjunction with the Download-command option.
It defines text to be written to the terminal emulator (via standard output)
immediately prior to starting the download command.  This is useful for
integrated serial line file transfer agents that permit command passing
(e.g., Kermit's APC method).

The special token \"_FILE_\" may be included in the string specification.
That symbol will be replaced with the (Pine-created) name of the temporary
file into which Pine will place the message to be downloaded.

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_mailcap_path ======
        OPTION: mailcap-search-path

This variable is used to replace Pine's default mailcap file search path.
It takes one or more file names (full paths must be specified) in which to
look for mail capability data.  The default search path can be found in the
release notes (\"R\" command off the main menu).

        ~/.mailcap:/etc/mailcap:/usr/etc/mailcap:/usr/local/etc/mailcap

If there is more than one file name listed, list members should be delimited
by a colon (:) under UNIX and a semi-colon (;) under DOS.

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_mimetype_path ======
        OPTION: mimetype-search-path

This variable is used to replace Pine's default mime.types file search path.
It takes one or more file names (full paths must be specified) in which to
look for file-name-extension to MIME type mapping data.  The default search
path can be found in the release notes (\"R\" command off the main menu).

If there is more than one file name listed, list members should be delimited
by a colon (:) under UNIX and a semi-colon (;) under DOS.

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_set_att_ansi2 ======
        OPTION: Set printer to attached ansi printer (no formfeed)

Type \"S\" to set your printer to \"attached-to-ansi-no-formfeed\".
It is OK to include \"attached-to-ansi-no-formfeed\" in your personal
list below.

This is the same as the \"attached-to-ansi\" option except that a
formfeed character will not be appended to the end of the print job.
If your printer already ejects the paper by itself at the end of the
job, you may prefer the \"no-formfeed\" form of this printer so that you
don't get an extra blank page between print jobs.

====== h_config_set_stand_print ======
        OPTION: Set default printer

Move to the printer you want and type \"S\" to set it to be your
default printer.  This list is not modifiable by you and has been
set up by the system administrators.  If there is more than one printer
listed in the Command List, you will be able to cycle through that
whole list at the time you print, starting with your default.
It is OK to include entries from this Standard list in your personal

        OPTION: Set default printer

You may add as many print commands as you want to your personal list.
Specify one of them as your default printer by moving to the printer
you want and typing \"S\".  If there is more than one printer listed
in the Command List, you will be able to cycle through that list at
the time you print, starting with your default.  It is OK to include
entries from the Standard list above or to include the command
\"attached-to-ansi\" or \"attached-to-ansi-no-formfeed\" as one of the
entries here.

====== h_config_user_id =====
        OPTION: User-Identification

This value is used as part of the \"From\" address on messages you send.
It is also the default login name for remote IMAP server access.  Set this
to the username part you want to appear on outgoing email.

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_user_dom =====
        OPTION: User-Domain

This value specifies the domain part (right-hand side) of your return
address on outgoing email and is also used as the default domain for email
composed to a local user.  If unset, Unix Pine will obtain the domain from
the system.  Often this value will be set for your whole site by the
system administrator.

If you set this, see also the \"quell-user-lookup-in-passwd-file\" feature.


<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_smtp_server =====
        OPTION: SMTP-Server

This value specifies the name of one or more SMTP servers for sending
mail. You must have an SMTP server for use with PC-Pine.  SMTP servers are
normally setup by a system administrator for use by all members of a given
campus or department.  Contact your local help desk to ask what SMTP
servers you should use.  Unix Pine users do not need to use an SMTP server
and can leave this blank.

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_nntp_server =====
        OPTION: NNTP-Server

This value specifies the name of the NNTP (Network News Transfer Protocol)
server for reading and posting USENET news.  NNTP servers are normally
setup by a system administrator for use by all members of a given campus
or department.  Contact your local help desk to ask what NNTP servers you
should use.  Often Unix Pine users will find that this variable has been
set for the whole system (and you don't have to worry about it).  When you
define an NNTP server here, Pine implicitly defines a news collection for
you, assuming that server as the news server and assuming that you will
use the NNTP protocol and a local newsrc configuration file for reading
news.  For more about reading news with Pine, see the release notes.

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_inbox_path =====
        OPTION: Inbox-Path

This value overrides the default value of your INBOX name/path/location.
PC-Pine users must specify an inbox path and it must be a folder on an
IMAP server.  Unix and VMS Pine users will often find that this variable
has been pre-configured by your system administrator.  You may be able to
specify an alternate INBOX which is either a local folder or a folder on
an IMAP server.

A typical remote inbox-path entry would be: {{:{}monet.art.nowhere.edu}INBOX
where \"monet.art.nowhere.edu\" is replaced by the name of your IMAP
mail server.

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_folder_spec =====
        OPTION: Folder-Collections

Folder collections are \"places\" to store folders.  They roughly
correspond to a filesystem \"directory\". Pine will normally provide you
with one folder collection by default.  Using this option, you may
specify additional collections.  These collections may be local or remote,
but they must correspond to a pre-existing filesystem directory, i.e.
Pine will not create any directory other than the original default.

The first folder collection listed here is the default collection for the
Save command -- the place various folders are put unless you specify
otherwise.

A valid local collection is just the specification of a directory on the
local system followed by square brackets.  For example, \"ART-101\\[]\" may
be valid on a PC and \"exhibit/[]\" may be valid on Unix.

Pine also allows you to access a collection on a remote computer (provided
it supports IMAP and you have the right to store folders on it).
To specify a remote folder collection, you need to give the name of the
IMAP mail server, the name of the collection on that server, and the square
brackets.  For instance, \"{{:{}wharhol.art.nowhere.edu}art-101/[]\" is a
remote collection.  As you can tell, the name of the computer is in {{:{}}
brackets followed immediately by the name of the collection.

Collection syntax:

 optional-label {{:{}optional-imap-hostname}optional-directory-path[]

Additional examples:

 Saved-Email {{:{}klee.art.nowhere.edu}mail/[]  <-- Remote collection
 Widget-Project widget/[]                   <-- Local collection (Unix)
 Desktop        MAIL\\[]                    <-- Local collection (PC)

Use the following SETUP CONFIGURATION commands to manipulate your folder
collections list:

 {F9 : A}  Add Value
 {F10: D}  Delete Value
 {F4 : C}  Change the current setting

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_news_spec =====
         OPTION: News-Collections

This value defines one or more collections of incoming newsgroup folders;
however, most people will not need to use this option since setting the
nntp-server option will implicitly define the most common news-collection
configuration.

You can use this to set a specific news collection other than that defined
implicitly by defining an NNTP server.  News collections defined here can
take several forms:

  Partial newsfeeds:            News *{{:{}news.nowhere.edu/nntp}[comp.*]
  News on the local host:       News *[]
  Newsfeeds accessed via IMAP:  News *{{:{}news.nowhere.edu}[]

====== h_config_default_fcc =====
         OPTION: Default-FCC (File Carbon Copy)

This value specifies where a copy of outgoing mail should be saved.  If
this is not a path name, it will be in the default collection for saves.
Any valid folder specification, local or IMAP, is allowed.  This default
folder carbon copy only applies when the fcc-rule-name (see later in this
configuration screen) is set to use the default folder.  Unix Pine default
is normally \"sent-mail\" in the default folder collection. PC-Pine
default is \"SENTMAIL\" (normally stored as SENTMAIL.MTX)

This option determines the default folder name for Saves...  If
this is not a path name, it will be in the default collection for saves.
Any valid folder specification, local or IMAP, is allowed.  This default
folder only applies when the saved-msg-name-rule (see later in this
configuration screen) doesn't override it.  Unix Pine default
is normally \"saved-messages\" in the default folder collection. PC-Pine
default is \"SAVEMAIL\" (normally stored as SAVEMAIL.MTX)

This value overrides the default name for the folder where postponed
messages are saved.  If this is not a path name, it will be in the default
collection for message Saves.  Any valid folder specification, local or
remote, is allowed.  The Unix Pine default is normally \"postponed-msgs\"
in the default collection. PC-Pine default is \"POSTPOND\" (stored as
POSTPOND.MTX).

====== h_config_read_message_folder =====
         OPTION: Read-Message-Folder

By virtue of specifying a folder name here, Pine will be configured to
save all messages which you have read during a session into the designated
\"read messages\" folder.  This allows you to more easily distinguish
between your really new email (in your INBOX) and those which you have
already read.  Depending on how you define the \"auto-move-read-messages\"
setting in the \"feature-list\", you may or may not be asked when you quit
Pine if you want read messages to be moved to this folder.  In either
case, moving the messages means they will be deleted from your INBOX.

If this is not a path name, it will be in the default collection for
saves.  Any valid folder specification, local or remote (via IMAP), is
allowed.  There is no default for the name of the read message folder.

FOR MORE INFORMATION: From the Main Menu, select \"L FOLDER LIST\" and
press \"?\" for Help and look for the section \"Valid Folder Names\".

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_archived_folders =====
         OPTION: Incoming-Archive-Folders

This is like Read-Message-Folder, only more general.  You may archive
any of the folders in your incoming collection.  This is a list of folder
pairs, with the first separated from the second in the pair by a space.
The first folder in a pair is the folder you want to archive, and the
second folder is the folder that read messages from the first should be
moved to.  Depending on how you define the \"auto-move-read-messages\"
setting in the \"feature-list\", you may or may not be asked when you
leave the first folder if you want read messages to be moved to the
second folder.  In either case, moving the messages means they will be
deleted from the first folder.

If these are not path names, they will be in the default collection for
saves.  Any valid folder specification, local or remote (via IMAP), is
allowed.  There is no default.

====== h_config_newsrc_path ======
        OPTION: newsrc-path

This option overrides the default name Pine uses for your \"newsrc\" news
status and subscription file.  If set, Pine will take this value as the
full pathname for the desired newsrc file.

If this option is not set, Unix Pine looks for the file ~/.newsrc and
PC-Pine looks first for  $HOME\\NEWSRC  (where $HOME defaults to the root
of the current drive, e.g. \"C:\\\" ) and then it looks in the same
directory as your pinerc file for NEWSRC.

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_signature_file =====
        OPTION: Signature-File

This is the name of a file which will be automatically inserted into
outgoing messages.  It typically contains information such as your name,
email address and organizational affiliation.  Pine adds the signature
into the message as soon as you enter the composer so you can choose to
remove it on a message by message basis.  Signature file placement in
message replies is controlled by the \"signature-at-bottom\" setting in
the feature list.

The default file name on Unix is \".signature\"; on PC-Pine the file is in
the same directory as your PINERC file, under the name \"\\PINE.SIG\".
The signature file must be kept on the local system, not a remote IMAP
server.

To create or edit your signature file choose Setup from the Main Menu
and then select S for Signature (Main/Setup/Signature).  This puts you
into the Signature Editor where you can enter a *few* lines of text
containing your identity and affiliation.

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_addressbook =====
        OPTION: Address-Book

This value overrides the default name of your personal address book file.
You may also define additional personal address books, to which you
may add selected addresses from within Pine.

The default is to have a single address book.  On Unix the file is named
\"~/.addressbook\" and on PCs the file is in the same directory as your
PINERC file, under the name \"\\ADDRBOOK\".

At this time address books must be kept on the local system, not a remote
IMAP server.  If you override the default name for PC-Pine's addressbook,
do not add a filename extension, since Pine will use your specified name
and add a \".lu\" extension when it generates its auxiliary index (look
up) file.

You may optionally precede the file name with a label that will be used
for identification in the ADDRESS BOOK display.  For example:

   PERSONAL addrbook

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_global_addrbook ==========
        OPTION: Global-Address-Book

This value specifies the name(s) of global (system-wide) address books. 
Defining these will typically be done in the system-wide Pine
configuration file by your system administrator.  This option may be used
to specify a shared workgroup addressbook, or to override the system-wide
default, if it exists. 

You may optionally precede the file name with a label that will be used
for identification in the ADDRESS BOOK display.  For example:

   WORKGROUP wgaddrbk

Global address books must be accessible via normal file access routines
on the machine where Pine is running.  Unlike personal address books,
global address books may not be modified/updated from within Pine;
that is, they are Read-Only.

There is no default value for this option.

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_init_cmd_list =====
        OPTION: Initial-Keystroke-List

The initial keystroke --or command-- list option lets you start Pine at
any place you like.  Whatever keystrokes you specify here will be executed
by Pine upon startup as a macro.  The words SPACE, TAB, DOWN, UP, LEFT, and
RIGHT indicate the pressing of those keys.  CR indicates the pressing of
the RETURN key.  F1 through F12 represent the function keys.  For example,
to view message 1 on startup, you would specify i,j,1,CR,v.

Restriction: You cannot pre-type into the composer with the initial
keystroke list.

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_comp_hdrs =====
        OPTION: Default-Composer-Headers

You can decide which headers you want visible when composing outgoing
email using this option.  You can specify any of the regular set, any rich
header or any custom header which you have already defined.  If you use
this setting at all, you must specify all the headers you want to see, you
can't just add to the regular header set.  The default set is To:, Cc:,
Attchmnt:, and Subject:.

Note that the \"Newsgroups:\" header will be abbreviated in the Composer
display, but should be spelled-in-full here.

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_custom_hdrs =====
        OPTION: Customized-Headers

You may add your own custom headers to all outgoing messages.  Each header
you specify here must include the header tag (Reply-To:, Approved:, etc.)
and may optionally include a value for that header.  If you want to see
these custom headers each time you compose a message, you must add them to
your default composer headers list (see above), otherwise they become part
of the rich header set which you only see when you press the rich header
(Ctrl-R) command.

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_viewer_headers =====
        OPTION: Viewer-Headers

You may change the default list of headers that are viewed by listing
the headers you want to view here.  If the headers in your \"viewer-hdrs\"
list are present in the message, then they will be shown.  The order of
the headers you list will be honored.  If the special value \"all-except\"
is included as the first header in the \"viewer-hdrs\" list, then all headers
in the message except those in the list will be shown.  The values are
all case insensitive.

Note that once you put anything in the \"viewer-hdrs\" list, then the
original default headers are ignored.  So, if you just wanted to add
the header Organization to the list, you'd have to list Organization plus
all of the other headers originally in the default list.  If you just
included Organization and nothing else, then you'd see only the Organization
header, nothing else.

The default list of headers includes:  From, Resent-From, To, Resent-To,
Cc, Resent-cc, Bcc, Newsgroups, Followup-To, Date, Resent-Date,
Subject, Resent-Subject, and Reply-To.

<End of help on this topic>

====== h_config_saved_msg_name_rule =====
        OPTION: Saved-Msg-Name-Rule

This option determines the default folder name when saving (i.e. using
the Save option) a message.  Choose one of the following:
default-folder, last-folder-used, by-from, by-sender, by-recipient,
by-nick-of-from, by-nick-of-sender, by-nick-of-recip, by-fcc-of-from,  
by-fcc-of-sender, by-fcc-of-recip, by-nick-of-from-then-from,
by-nick-of-sender-then-sender, by-nick-of-recip-then-recip,
by-fcc-of-from-then-from,  by-fcc-of-sender-then-sender,
or by-fcc-of-recip-then-recip.

The default option is \"default-folder\", which is the folder called 
 \"saved-messages\" in Unix Pine and \"savemail\" in PC-Pine.  To change
the default folder, modify the variable called 
\"default-saved-msg-folder\". 

Choosing any of the \"by-\" options cause Pine to attempt to get the
chosen option's value for the message being saved.  For example, if
\"by-from\" is chosen, Pine attempts to get the value of who the message
came from (i.e. the from address).  Pine then attempts to save the message
to a folder matching that value. If \"by-from\" is chosen and no value is
obtained, Pine uses \"by-sender\". The opposite is also true.  If
\"by-recipient\" was chosen and the message was posted to a newsgroup,
Pine will use the newsgroup name. 

If any of the \"by-nick\" options are chosen, the resulting address is
looked up in the user's address book and if found, the nickname for that
entry is used.  Similarly, if any of the \"by-fcc\" options are chosen,
the fcc from the corresponding address book entry is used.  If no value
is found in the address book, then if the chosen option ends with the
\"then-from\", \"then-sender\", or \"then-recip\" suffix, Pine reverts to
the same behavior as \"by-from\", \"by-sender\" or \"by-recipient\"
depending on which option was specified.  If the chosen option doesn't
end with one of the \"then-\" suffixes, then Pine reverts to the default
folder when no match is found in the address book.

Choosing the option called \"last-folder-used\", causes Pine to save to
the folder that you saved to the last time you saved a message.  The first
time you save a message in a Pine session, Pine attempts to save the
message to the default folder. 

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_fcc_rule =====
        OPTION: FCC-Name-Rule

This option determines the default name for folder carbon copy. Choose
one: default-fcc, last-fcc-used, by-recipient, by-nickname,
by-nick-then-recip, or current-folder.

Normal default is \"default-fcc\", the value of which is set in
the \"default-fcc\" variable as specified earlier in this configuration.

The option \"last-fcc-used\" puts the folder that was last used in the fcc 
field.

The option \"by-nickname\" means that it will use the nickname from your
address book that matches the first address in the To line.  If there is
no match, it will use the value of the \"default-fcc\" variable.

The option \"by-recipient\" means it will form a folder name based on
the left hand side of the first address in the To line.

The option \"by-nick-then-recip\" means that it will use the matching
nickname from your address book if there is one, otherwise it will
extract the recipient name from the address and use that (like
by-recipient).

The option \"current-folder\" causes a copy to be written to the currently 
open folder, unless that is the INBOX.  In the case where the current 
folder is the INBOX, the \"default-fcc\" is used instead.

Note that whatever the fcc specified by the rule here, it will be
over-ridden by any fcc entries you have in your address book.

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_sort_key =====
        OPTION: Sort-Key

This option determines the order in which messages will be displayed in
the Folder Index screen.  Choose from:

 o Date -- Sort folders according to the date and time they were
     sent. On a folder like INBOX, sorting by \"Date\" should be almost
     identical to sorting by \"Arrival\".
 o Arrival -- Sort messages into the order in which they arrived.
 o From -- Sort messages by the name of the author of the message.
     Messages with the same author are grouped together. Groups of
     messages are then put into alphabetical order according to message
     author.
 o Subject -- Sort messages by subject. Messages with the same
     subject are grouped together. Pine ignores leading \"Re:\" and \"re:\"
     and trailing \"(fwd)\" when determining the likeness and
     alphabetical order of subject lines. Groups of messages are put
     into alphabetical order according to subject.
 o OrderedSubj -- Grouping of all messages with the same subject
     together is done in the same way as sort by subject. With
     \"OrderedSubj\" however, groups of messages are put into date order
     according to the oldest message on a given subject. This sorting
     provides pseudo threading of messages.
 o ReverseDate -- Like \"Date\" but the newest message is first.
 o ReverseArrival -- Like \"Arrival\" but the newest message is first.
 o ReverseFrom -- Like \"From\" but groups of messages are ordered in
     reverse alphabetical order (Z-A).
 o ReverseSubject -- Like \"Subject\" but groups of messages are
     ordered in reverse alphabetical order (Z-A).
 o ReverseOrderedSubj -- Like \"OrderedSubj\" but groups of messages
     are ordered with the newest groups first (according to the first
     message of each group).

Normal default is \"arrival\".

====== h_config_ab_sort_rule =====
        OPTION: Address-Book-Sort-Rule

This option controls the order in which address book entries will be
presented.  Choose one of the following:

fullname                  use fullname field, lists mixed in
fullname-with-lists-last  use fullname field, but put lists at end
nickname                  use nickname field, lists mixed in
nickname-with-lists-last  use nickname field, but put lists at end
dont-sort                 don't change order of file

The normal default is \"fullname-with-lists-last\".

====== h_config_char_set =====
        OPTION: Character-Set

The character set is used primarily to mark outgoing email appropriately.
Set it to whatever character set you might use to compose messages.
Whenever you actually send a message, Pine checks it to see if it is, in
fact, US-ASCII (a subset of the other sets allowable). If it is US-ASCII,
the outgoing message will be marked as such no matter what you have set as
your character set. Normal default is US-ASCII.  Typical alternatives
include ISO-8859-x, where x is a number between 1 and 9.

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_editor =====
        OPTION: Editor

Editor specifies the program invoked by ^_ in the Composer. This is
normally an alternative to Pine's internal composer (Pico).  You could use
this setting to specify an alternate editor to use occasionally or if you
have a favorite editor and want to use it all the time (see the \"enable-
alternate-editor-implicitly\" setting).

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_speller =====
        OPTION: Speller

This option affects the behavior of the ^T (spell check) command in the
Composer.  It specifies the program invoked by ^T in the Composer.  By
default, Pine uses the system's \"spell\" command.  Pine will use the
command defined by this option (if any) instead.  When invoking the
spell-checking program, Pine appends a tempfile name (where the message is
passed) to the command line.

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_display_filters =====
        OPTION: Display-Filters

This option defines a list of text-filtering commands (programs or
scripts) that may be used to filter text portions of received messages
prior to their use (e.g., presentation in the \"MESSAGE TEXT\" display
screen).  For security reasons, the full path name of the filter command 
must be specified. 

The command is executed and the message is piped into its standard input. 
The standard output of the command is read back by Pine.  The
\"_TMPFILE_\" token (see below) overrides this default behavior. 
 
The filter's use is based on the configured \"trigger\" string.  The
format of a filter definition is:
   
        <trigger> <command> <arguments>

You can specify as many filters as you wish, separating them with a comma.  
Each filter can have only one trigger and command.  Thus, two trigger 
strings which invoke the same command require separate filter 
specifications. 
 
The \"trigger\" is simply text that, if found in the message, will invoke
the associated command.  If the trigger contains any space characters, it
must be placed within quotes.  Likewise, should you wish a filter to be
invoked unconditionally, define the trigger as the null string, \"\" (two
consecutive double-quote characters).  If the trigger string is found
anywhere in the text of the message the filter is invoked.  Placing the
trigger text within the tokens defined below changes where within the text
the trigger must be before considering it a match. 
  
 Trigger Modifying Tokens:

   _CHARSET(string)_    This token tells Pine to invoke the supplied command
                        if the text is in a character set matching \"string\"
                        (e.g., ISO-8859-2 or ISO-2022-JP).

   _LEADING(string)_    This token tells Pine to invoke the supplied command
                        if the enclosed \"string\" is found to be the first
                        non-whitespace text.
                        NOTE: Quotes are necessary if \"string\" contains
                              the space character.

   _BEGINNING(string)_  This token tells Pine to invoke the supplied command
                        if the enclosed \"string\" is found at the beginning
                        of any line in the text.
                        NOTE: Quotes are necessary if \"string\" contains
                              the space character.

The \"command\" and \"arguments\" portion is simply the command line to be
invoked if the trigger string is found.  Below are tokens that Pine will
recognize and replace with special values when the command is actually
invoked. 

Command Modifying Tokens:

   _RECIPIENTS_         When the command is executed, this token is replaced 
                        with the space delimited list of recipients of the 
                        message being displayed.
                        
   _TMPFILE_            When the command is executed, this token is 
                        replaced with the path and name of the temporary 
                        file containing the text to be filtered.  Pine 
                        expects the filter to replace this data with the 
                        filter's result.

                        Note: Use of this token implies that the text to 
			be filtered is not piped into standard input of the 
			executed command and its standard output is ignored. 
			Pine restores the tty modes before invoking the
                        filter in case the filter interacts with the user
                        via its own standard input and output.  
                        
   _RESULTFILE_         When the command is executed, this token is 
			replaced with the path and name of a temporary 
			file intended to contain a status message from the 
			filter.  Pine displays this in the message status 
			field. 
 
   _DATAFILE_           When the command is executed, this token is 
			replaced with the path and name of a temporary 
			file that Pine creates once per session and deletes 
			upon exit.  The file is intended to be used by the 
			filter to store state information between instances 
			of the filter.
   
   _PREPENDKEY_         When the command is executed, this token indicates 
			that a random number will be passed down the input 
			stream before the message text.  This number could 
			be used as a session key.  It is sent in this way 
			to improve security.  The number is unique to the 
			current Pine session and is only generated once per 
			session. 

Performance caveat/considerations:

Testing for the trigger and invoking the filter doesn't come for free.
There is overhead associated with searching for the trigger string, testing
for the filter's existence and actually piping the text through the filter.
The impact can be reduced if the Trigger Modifying Tokens above are 
employed.

====== h_config_sending_filter =====
        OPTION: Sending-Filters
      
This option defines a list of text-filtering commands (programs and
scripts) that may be selectively invoked to process a message just before
it is sent.  If set, the Composer's ^X (Send) command will allow you to
select which filter (or none) to apply to the message before it is sent. 
For security reasons, the full path of the filter program must be
specified. 

 Command Modifying Tokens:

   _RECIPIENTS_         When the command is executed, this token is replaced 
			with the space delimited list of recipients of the 
			message being sent. 
        
   _TMPFILE_            When the command is executed, this token is 
			replaced with the path and name of the temporary 
			file containing the text to be filtered.  Pine 
			expects the filter to replace this data with the 
			filter's result.

			Note: Use of this token implies that the text to 
			be filtered is not piped into standard input of the 
			executed command and its standard output is ignored. 
			Pine restores the tty modes before invoking the
                        filter in case the filter interacts with the user
                        via its own standard input and output.  
                        
   _RESULTFILE_         When the command is executed, this token is 
			replaced with the path and name of a temporary 
			file intended to contain a status message from the 
			filter.  Pine displays this in the message status 
			field. 
 
   _DATAFILE_           When the command is executed, this token is replaced 
			in the command line with the path and name of a 
			temporary file that Pine creates once per session 
			and deletes upon exit.  The file is intended to be 
	   		used by the filter to store state information between 
			instances of the filter.
   
   _PREPENDKEY_         When the command is executed, this token indicates 
			that a random number will be passed down the input 
			stream before the message text.  This number could 
			be used as a session key.  It is sent in this way 
			to improve security.  The number is unique to the 
			current Pine session and is only generated once per 
			session. 
   
NOTE: Only the body text, which is visible in the Composer, is piped
      through this filter.  Attachments are not sent to the filter.

====== h_config_alt_addresses =====
        OPTION: Alt-Addresses

This option provides a place for you to list alternative email addresses
you may have.  If set, the option affects the behavior of the Reply
command and the \"+\" symbol in the Folder Index, which denotes that
a message has been addressed specifically to you.

With respect to Reply, the reply-to-all option will exclude addresses
listed here.

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_abook_formats =====
        OPTION: Addressbook-Formats

This option specifies the format that address books are displayed in.
Normally, address books are displayed with the nicknames in the first
column, the fullnames in the second column, and addresses in the third
column.  The system figures out reasonable defaults for the widths of
the columns.  An address book may be given a different format by
listing special tokens in the order you want them to display.  The
possible tokens are NICKNAME, FULLNAME, ADDRESS, FCC, and COMMENT.
So, for example, to get the default behavior you could list

addressbook-formats=NICKNAME FULLNAME ADDRESS

(You can also use the token DEFAULT to get the default behavior for
an address book format.)

The tokens are separated by spaces.  \"Addressbook-formats\" is a list,
so if you have more than one address book you may have a separate format
for each by putting its format at the corresponding location in the
\"addressbook-formats\" list.  Listed first are the personal address books,
then the global address books.  So, if you have two personal address
books and one global address book, you may have up to three formats in
the \"addressbook-formats\" list.  If \"addressbook-formats\" doesn't
have as many elements as there are address books, the last element is
used repeatedly.  Each of the tokens may also be optionally followed
by parentheses with either a number or a percentage inside the parentheses.
For example, FULLNAME(13) means to allocate 13 characters of space to
the fullnames column, FULLNAME(20%) means to allocate 20% of the
available space (the screen width minus the space for inter-column spaces)
to the fullnames column, while plain FULLNAME means the system will
attempt to figure out a reasonable number of columns.  There are
always 2 spaces between every column, so if you use fixed column
widths (like 13) you should remember to take that into account.

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_index_format =====
        OPTION: Index-Format

This option specifies the format that folder indexes are displayed in.
Normally, the system figures out reasonable defaults for the widths of
the columns of the index display.  A non-standard display format can be
used by listing special tokens in the order you want them to display.  The
tokens are STATUS, FULLSTATUS, MSGNO, DATE, SIZE, DESCRIPSIZE, SUBJECT,
FROMORTO, FROM, and TO.  The tokens are separated by spaces.
Each of the tokens may also be optionally followed by parentheses with
either a number or a percentage inside the parentheses.  For example,
SUBJECT(13) means to allocate 13 characters of space to the subject
column, SUBJECT(20%) means to allocate 20% of the available space to
the subjects column, while plain SUBJECT means the system will attempt
to figure out a reasonable amount of space.  There is always one space
between every column, so if you use fixed column widths (like 13) you
should remember to take that into account.  Several of the fields are
virtually fixed-width, so it doesn't make much sense to specify the width
for them.  The fields STATUS, FULLSTATUS, MSGNO, DATE, SIZE, and DESCRIPSIZE
all fall into that category.  You *may* specify widths for those if you
wish, but you're probably better off letting the system pick those widths.
FROMORTO just means it will list the From address unless it is you, in
which case it will list the TO address.  The default is equivalent to:

index-format=STATUS MSGNO DATE FROMORTO(33%) SIZE SUBJECT(67%)

This means that the four fields without percentages will be allocated
first, and then 33% and 67% of the *remaining* space will go to the from
and subject fields.  If one of those two fields is specified as a percentage
and the other is left for the system to choose, then the percentage is
taken as an absolute percentage of the screen, not of the space remaining
after allocating the first four columns.  It doesn't usually
make sense to do it that way.  If you leave off all the widths, then the
subject and from fields (if both are present) are allocated space in a
2 to 1 ratio, which is almost exactly the same as the default.

The token FROM is like FROMORTO, except that it always shows the From
address, even if it is you.  TO always shows the first address from the
TO line, or the first newsgroup if there is no To.  SENDER can be used
to show the Sender of the message, as opposed to what is in the From line.

STATUS is three characters wide, with the first column showing '*' for
messages marked Important, or '+' for messages addressed to you, or
nothing.  The second column is blank (and is sometimes used for the
cursor) and the third column shows the letter 'D' if the message is
deleted, or 'A' if it is answered (but not deleted), or 'N' if it is
new (but not deleted or answered).  FULLSTATUS is an alternate form of
the STATUS field.  It is six characters wide.  The first column is '+'
or blank, the third column is '*' or blank, the fourth column is 'N' or
blank, the fifth column is 'A' or blank, and the sixth column is 'D' or
blank.

DESCRIPSIZE is intended to be a more useful description of the message
than just its size in bytes, but it isn't very useful at this point.  The
plus sign in the DESCRIPSIZE view means there are attachments.

What you are most likely to do with this configuration option is to
specify which fields appear at all, which order they appear in, and the
percentage of screen that is used for the from and subject fields if you
don't like the 2 to 1 default.

====== h_config_composer_wrap_column =====
        OPTION: Composer-Wrap-Column

This option specifies an aspect of Pine's Composer.  This gives the
maximum width that auto-wrapped lines will have.  It's also the maximum
width of lines justified using the ^J Justify command.  The normal default
is \"74\".  The largest allowed setting is normally \"80\" in order to
prevent very long lines from being sent in outgoing mail.  When the mail
is actually sent, trailing spaces will be stripped off of each line.

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_viewer_overlap =====
        OPTION: Viewer-Overlap

This option specifies an aspect of Pine's Message Viewing screen.  When
the space bar is used to page forward in a message, the number of lines
specified by the \"viewer-overlap\" variable will be repeated from the
bottom of the screen.  That is, if this was set to two lines, then the
bottom two lines of the screen would be repeated on the top of the next
screen.  The normal default value is \"2\".

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_scroll_margin =====
        OPTION: Scroll-margin

This option controls when Pine's line-by-line scrolling occurs.
Typically, when a selected item is at the top or bottom screen edge
and the UP or DOWN (and Ctrl-P or Ctrl-N) keys are struck, the
displayed items are scrolled down or up by a single line.

This option allows you to tell Pine the number of lines from the top and
bottom screen edge that line-by-line paging should occcur.  For example,
setting this value to one (1) will cause Pine to scroll the display
vertically when you move to select an item on the display's top or
bottom edge.

By default, this variable is zero, indicating that scrolling happens
when you move up or down to select an item immediately off the display's
top or bottom edge.

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_reply_indent_string =====
        OPTION: Reply-Indent-String

This variable specifies an aspect of Pine's Reply command.  When a message
is replied to and the text of the message is included, that text
usually has the string \"> \" prepended to each line to indicate quoting.

This variable specifies a different value for that string.  If you wish to
use a string which begins or ends with a space, enclose the string in double
quotes.

You can also include the sender's name in the prepended string.  The first
occurrence of \"_FROM_\" in the reply-indent-string will be replaced with
the \"username\" portion of the address being replied to.

The normal default is \"> \".

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_empty_hdr_msg =====
        OPTION: Empty-Header-Message

When sending, if all of the To, Cc, and Newsgroups fields are empty,
Pine will put a special address in the To line.  The default value is
\"Undisclosed recipients: ;\".  The reason for this is to avoid
embarrassment caused by some Internet mail transfer software that
interprets a \"missing\" To: header as an error and replaces it with an
Apparently-to: header that may contain the addresses you entered on the
Bcc: line, defeating the purpose of the Bcc.  You may change the part
of this message that comes before the \": ;\" by setting the
\"Empty-Header-Message\" variable to something else.

The normal default is \"Undisclosed recipients\".

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_status_msg_delay =====
        Experimental OPTION: Status-Message-Delay

If this is set to a positive number, it causes the cursor to move to the
status line whenever a status message is printed and pause there for this
many seconds.  It will probably only be useful if the show-cursor feature
is also turned on.

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_mailcheck =====
        OPTION: Mail-Check-Interval

This options specifies, in seconds, how often Pine will check for new
mail.  If set to zero, new-mail checking is disabled.  There is a minimum
value, normally 15 seconds.

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_news_active =====
        OPTION: News-Active-File-Path

This option tells Pine where to look for the \"active file\" for newsgroups
when accessing news locally, rather than via NNTP.  The default path is
usually \"/usr/lib/news/active\".

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_news_spool =====
        OPTION: News-Spool-Directory

This option tells Pine where to look for the \"news spool\" for newsgroups
when accessing news locally, rather than via NNTP.  The default path is
usually \"/usr/spool/news\".

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_image_viewer =====
        OPTION: Image-Viewer

This option specifies the program Pine should call to view MIME
attachments of type IMAGE (e.g. GIF or TIFF).  The Image Viewer setting is
no longer needed, but remains for backward compatibility.  The more
general method for associating external printing and viewing programs with
specific MIME data types is to use the system's (or your personal)
\"mailcap\" configuration file.

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_domain_name =====
        OPTION: Use-Only-Domain-Name

This option is used only if the \"user-domain\" option is *not* set.  If set
to \"Yes\" (and user-domain is not used), then Pine strips the hostname from
your return (\"From\") address and when completing unqualified addresses
that you enter into the composer.

If you set this, see also the \"quell-user-lookup-in-passwd-file\" feature.

This option is not applicable to PC-Pine.

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_prune_date =====
        OPTION: Last-Time-Prune Question

This value records the last time you were asked about deleting old
sent-mail. It is set automatically by Pine at the beginning of each
month. If you wish to suppress the monthly sent-mail pruning feature, set
this to a date in the future, e.g. 99.12

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_goto_default =====
        OPTION: goto-default-rule

This value affects Pine's behavior when you use the Goto command.
Pine's usual behavior has two parts.  If your current folder is \"Inbox\",
Pine will offer the last open folder as the default.  If the current
folder is other than \"Inbox\", \"Inbox\" is offered as the default.

There are three possible values for this option.  The default just
described:

        inbox-or-folder-in-recent-collection

The second accepted value is a variation on the default which again
offers \"Inbox\" if it isn't currently open, but otherwise offers the
most recent folder in the first collection found in the \"FOLDER LIST\"
screen.  It's called:

        inbox-or-folder-in-first-collection

The last accepted value simply causes the most recently opened folder
to be offered as the default regardless of the currently opened folder.
It's called:

        most-recent-folder

NOTE: The default while a newsgroup is open remains the same; the last
open newsgroup.

====== h_config_enable_full_hdr =====
        FEATURE: enable-full-header-cmd

This feature enables the \"H Full Headers\" command which toggles between
the display of all headers in the message and the normal edited view of
headers.  The Full Header command also controls which headers are included
for Export, Pipe, Print, Forward, and Reply functions.  (For Reply, the
Full Header mode will respect the \"include-headers-in-reply\" feature
setting.)

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_enable_pipe =====
        FEATURE: enable-unix-pipe-cmd

This feature enables the \"| Pipe\" command that sends the current message
to the specified Unix command for external processing.  Not available on
PC-Pine.

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_enable_tab_complete =====
        FEATURE: enable-tab-completion

This feature enables the TAB key when at a prompt for a filename. In this
case, TAB will cause the partial name already entered to be automatically
completed, provided the partial name is unambiguous.

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_quit_wo_confirm =====
         FEATURE: quit-without-confirm

This feature controls whether or not Pine will ask for confirmation when a
Quit command is received.

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_enable_jump =====
         FEATURE: enable-jump-shortcut

Setting this feature will allow you to enter a number (followed by RETURN)
and jump to that message number, when in the FOLDER INDEX or MESSAGE TEXT
screens.  In other words, it obviates the need for typing the \"J\" for the
Jump command.

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_enable_alt_ed =====
        FEATURE: enable-alternate-editor-cmd

If this feature is set, and the \"editor\" variable is not set, entering
the ^_ (Control-underscore) key while composing a message will prompt you
for the name of the editor you would like to use.

If the environment variable $EDITOR is set, this value will be offered as
a default.

If \"editor\" variable is set, the ^_ key will activate the specified
editor without prompting, in which case it is not necessary to
set the \"enable-alternate-editor-cmd\" feature.  This feature is not
available in PC-Pine.

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_alt_ed_now =====
         FEATURE: enable-alternate-editor-implicitly

If this feature and the \"editor\" variable are both set, Pine will
automatically activate the specified editor when the cursor is moved from
the header of the message being composed into the message text.  For
replies, the alternate editor will be activated immediately.  If this
feature is set but the \"editor\" variable is not set, then Pine will
automatically ask for the name of an alternate editor when the cursor
is moved out of the header being composed, or if a reply is being done.
This feature is not available in PC-Pine.

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_enable_bounce =====
         FEATURE: enable-bounce-cmd

Setting this feature enables the \"B Bounce\" command, which will prompt
for an address and *remail* the message to the new recipient.  This command
is used to re-direct messages that you have received in error, or need to
be redirected for some other reason (e.g. list moderation).  The final
recipient will see a header indicating that you have Resent the msg, but
the message's From: header will show the original author of the message,
and replies to it will go back to that author, and not to you.

====== h_config_enable_agg_ops =====
         FEATURE: enable-aggregate-command-set

Setting this feature enables the commands and subcommands that relate to
performing operations on more than one message at a time.  We call these
\"aggregate operations\".  In particular, the \"; Select\", \"A Apply\",
and \"Z Zoom\" commands are enabled by this feature.  Select is used to
\"tag\" one or more messages meeting the specified criteria.  Apply can
then be used to apply any message command to all of the selected/tagged
messages.  Further, the Zoom command allows you to toggle the Folder Index
view between just those Selected and all messages in the folder.

This feature also enables the \"^X\" subcommand in the FOLDER INDEX WhereIs
command which causes all messages matching the WhereIs argument to become
selected.

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_enable_flag =====
         FEATURE: enable-flag-cmd

Setting this feature enables the \"* Flag\" command which allows you to
manipulate the status flags associated with a message.  By default, Flag
will set the \"Important\" flag, which results in an asterisk being
displayed in column one of the FOLDER INDEX for such messages.

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_flag_screen_default =====
         FEATURE: enable-flag-screen-implicitly

The feature modifies the behavior of the \"* Flag\" command (provided it
too is enabled).  By default, when the \"* Flag\" command is selected,
Pine offers a prompt to set one of several flags and also offers the
option of entering the detailed flag manipulation screen via the \"^T\"
key. Enabling this feature causes Pine to immediately enter the detailed
flag screen rather than first offer the simple prompt.

====== h_config_print_from ======
         FEATURE: print-includes-from-line

If this feature is set, then the Berkeley-mail style From line is included
at the start of each message that is printed.  This line looks something
like the following, with the address replaced by the address from the
From line of the message being printed:

   From user@domain.somewhere.com Mon May 13 14:11:06 1996

====== h_config_compose_news_wo_conf ======
         FEATURE: compose-sets-newsgroup-without-confirm

This feature controls one aspect of Pine's Composer.  If you enter the
composer while reading a news group, you will normally be prompted to
determine whether you intend the new message to be posted to the current
newsgroup or not.  If this feature is set, Pine will not prompt you
in this situation, and will assume that you do indeed wish to post
to the newsgroup you are reading.

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_compose_rejects_unqual ======
     FEATURE: compose-rejects-unqualified-addrs

This feature controls one aspect of the message composer; in particular,
what happens when an unqualified name is entered into an address header.
If set, unqualified names entered as addresses will be treated as errors
unless they match an addressbook nickname.  Pine will not attempt to turn
them into complete addresses by adding your local domain.

A complete (fully qualified) address is one containing a username followed
by an \"@\" symbol, followed by a host or domain name (e.g.
\"jsmith@nowhere.edu\").  An unqualified name is one *without* the \"@\"
symbol and host or domain name (e.g. \"jsmith\"),

When you enter a fully qualified address, Pine does not interpret or
modify it, but simply passes it on to the mail-transport-agent (MTA) for
your system.  Pine conforms to the Internet standards governing message
headers and will not send an unqualifed name to the MTA.  Therefore, when
you enter an unqualified name, Pine will normally attempt to turn it into
a fully qualified address, first by checking to see if you have entered a
matching nickname in your addressbook, or failing that, by simply adding
your own domain to the name entered.  So if your address is
\"jsmith@nowhere.edu\" and you enter \"fred\", then (assuming \"fred\" is
not a valid nickname), Pine will turn that into \"fred@nowhere.edu\".

There are situations where it is not desirable for Pine to interpret such
unqualified names as valid (local) addresses.  For example, if \"fred\"
turned out to be a typo (intended to be an addressbook nickname), but
there actually was a \"fred\" in your local domain, the message might be
mis-delivered without your realizing it.  In order to reduce the likelihood
of such accidents, setting this feature will cause Pine to treat such
addresses as errors, and require that you explicitly enter the full local
address (e.g. \"fred@nowhere.edu\") or correct the name so that it matches
an address book nickname.

Consider this a safety feature against mis-directed mail.

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_quell_local_lookup  ======
         FEATURE: quell-user-lookup-in-passwd-file

This feature controls an aspect of Pine's Composer, and if needed, will
usually be set by your system manager in Pine's system-wide configuration
file. Specifically, if this feature is set, Pine will not attempt to look
in the system password file to find a Full Name for the entered address.

Normally, names you enter into address fields (e.g. To: or Cc:) are
checked against your address book(s) to see if they match an address book
nickname.  Failing that, (in Unix Pine) the name is then checked against
the Unix password file.  If the entered name matches a username in the
system password file, Pine extracts the corresponding Full Name information
for that individual, and adds that to the address being entered.

However, password file matching can have surprising (incorrect) results if
other users of the system do not receive mail at the domain you are using.
That is, if either the \"user-domain\" or \"use-only-domain-name\" option
is set such that the administrative domain of other users on the system
isn't accurately reflected, Pine should be told that a passwd file match
is coincidental, and Full Name info will be incorrect.  For example, a
personal name from the password file could get falsely paired with the
entered name as it is turned into an address in the configured domain.

If you are seeing this behavior, enabling this feature will prevent Unix
Pine from looking up names in the password file to find the Full Name
for incomplete addresses you enter.

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_preserve_start_stop ======
         FEATURE: preserve-start-stop-characters

This feature controls how special control key characters, typically
Ctrl-S and Ctrl-Q, are interpreted when input to Pine.  These characters
are known as the \"start\" and \"stop\" characters and are sometimes used in
communications paths to control data flow between devices that operate at
different speeds.

By default, Pine turns the system's handling of these special characters
off except during printing.  However, if you see Pine reporting input errors
such as:

            [ Command \"^Q\" not defined for this screen. ]

and, at the same time, see your display become garbled, then it is likely
that setting this option will solve the problem.  Be aware, though, that
enabling this feature will also cause Pine to ostensibly \"hang\" 
whenever the Ctrl-S key combination is entered as the system is now
interpreting such input as a \"stop output\" command.  To \"start
output\"  again, simply type Ctrl-Q. 

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_enable_incoming ======
         FEATURE: enable-incoming-folders

If set, this feature defines a pseudo-folder collection called
\"INCOMING MESSAGE FOLDERS\".  Initially, the only folder included
in this collection will be your INBOX, which will no longer show up in
your default saved-message folder collection.

You may add more folders to the Incoming Message Folders collection by
using the \"{F10:A} Add\" command in the FOLDER LIST screen.  You will
be prompted for the host the folder is stored on (which defaults to the
same host used for your INBOX), a nickname, and the actual folder name.
Once a set of Incoming Message Folders are defined, the TAB key (in
FOLDER INDEX or MESSAGE TEXT screens) may be used to scan the folders
for those with Recent messages.

NOTE: Pine does not do \"delivery filtering\"; this is the province of
other programs such as \"filter\" or \"procmail\".  Pine's Incoming
Message Folders collection provides a convenient way to access multiple
incoming folders, once they are created by other programs.  It is also
useful if you have accounts on multiple computers.

====== h_config_include_header =====
         FEATURE: include-header-in-reply

This feature controls an aspect of Pine's Reply command. If set, and the
original message is being included in the reply, then headers from that
message will also be part of the reply.

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_sig_at_bottom =====
        FEATURE: signature-at-bottom

This feature controls an aspect of Pine's Reply command.  If this feature
is set, and the original message is being included in the reply, then the
contents of your signature file (if any) will be inserted after the included
message, and the cursor will also be positioned after the included text.

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_use_sender_not_x =====
        FEATURE: use-sender-not-X-Sender

Normally Pine adds a header line labeled X-Sender, if the sender is
different from the From: line.  The standard specifies that this header
line should be labeled Sender, not X-Sender.  Setting this feature causes
Sender to be used instead of X-Sender.

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_use_fk =====
        FEATURE: use-function-keys

This feature specifies that Pine will respond to function keys instead of
the normal single-letter commands. In this mode, the key menus at the
bottom of each screen will show function key designations instead of the
normal mnemonic key.

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_compose_maps_del =====
        FEATURE: compose-maps-delete-key-to-ctrl-d

This feature affects the behavior of the DELETE key.
If set, Delete will be equivalent to Control-D, and delete
the current character.  Normally Pine defines the Delete key
to be equivalent to Control-H, which deletes the *previous*
character.

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_compose_bg_post =====
        FEATURE: enable-background-sending

This feature affects the behavior of Pine's mail sending.  If set, this
feature enables a subcommand in the composer's \"Send?\" confirmation
prompt.  The subcommand allows you to tell Pine to handle the actual
posting in the background.  While this feature usually allows posting
to appear to happen very fast, it has no affect on the actual delivery
time it takes a message to arrive at its destination.

NOTE 1: This feature isn't supported on all systems.  All DOS and Windows,
        as well as several Unix ports, do not recognize this feature.

NOTE 2: Error handling is significantly different when this feature is
        enabled.  Any message posting failure results in the message
        being appended to your \"Interrupted\" mail folder.  When you
        type the \"Compose\" command, Pine will notice this folder and
        offer to extract any messages contained.  Upon continuing a 
        failed message, Pine will display the nature of the failure 
        in the status message line.

WARNING: Under extreme conditions, it is possible for message data to
         get lost.  Do not enable this feature if you typically run close
         to any sort of disk-space limits or quotas.

after the select is complete.

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_auto_unzoom =====
        FEATURE: auto-unzoom-after-apply

This feature affects the behavior of the Apply command.  If set, and if
you are currently looking at a Zoomed Index view of selected messages,
the Apply command will do the operation you specify, but then will
implicitly do an \"UnZoom\", so that you will automatically be back in
the normal Index view after the Apply.

rather than cutting the entire line.

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_print_index =====
        FEATURE: print-index-enabled

This feature controls the behavior of the Print command when in the
Folder Index screen.  If set, the print command will give you a prompt
asking if you wish to print the message index, or the currently selected
message.

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_allow_talk =====
        FEATURE: allow-talk

By default, permission for others to \"talk\" to your terminal is turned
off when you are running Pine.  When this feature is set, permission is
instead turned on.  If enabled, you may see unexpected messages in the
middle of your Pine screen from someone attempting to contact you via the
\"talk\" program.

Note: The \"talk\" program has nothing to do with Pine or email.  The 
talk daemon on your system will attempt to print a message on your screen 
when someone else is trying to contact you.  If you wish to see these
messages while you are running Pine, you should enable this feature.

If you do enable this feature and see a \"talk\" message, you must 
suspend or quit Pine before you can respond.

====== h_config_blank_keymenu =====
        FEATURE: disable-keymenu

If this feature is set the command key menu that normally appears on the
bottom two lines of the screen will not usually be there.  Asking for
help with ^G or ? will cause the key menu to appear instead of causing
the help message to come up.  If you want to actually see the help text,
another ^G or ? will show it to you.  After the key menu has popped
up with the help key it will remain there for an O for Other command but
disappear if any other command is typed.

====== h_config_enable_mouse =====
        FEATURE: enable-mouse-in-xterm

This feature controls whether or not an X terminal mouse can be used with
Pine.  If set, and the $DISPLAY variable indicates that an X terminal is
being used, the left mouse button on the mouse can be used to select text
or commands.

Note: if this feature is set, the behavior of X terminal cut-and-paste is
also modified.  It is necessary to hold the shift key down while clicking
left or middle mouse buttons for the normal xterm cut/paste operations.

====== h_config_enable_xterm_newmail =====
        FEATURE: enable-newmail-in-xterm-icon

This feature controls whether or not Pine will attempt to announce new
mail arrival when it is running in an X terminal window and that window
is iconified.  If set, and the $DISPLAY variable indicates that an X
terminal is being used, Pine will send appropriate escape sequences to
the X terminal to modify the label on Pine's icon to indicate that new
mail has arrived.

====== h_config_show_cursor =====
        FEATURE: show-cursor

This feature controls an aspect of Pine's displays.  If set, the system
cursor will move to convenient locations in the displays.  For example,

to the highlighted word after a successful WhereIs command.

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_vert_list =====
        FEATURE: single-column-folder-list

This feature controls an aspect of Pine's folder list screen.  If set,
the folders will be listed one per line instead of several per line
in the folder list display.

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_verbose_post =====
        FEATURE: enable-verbose-smtp-posting

This feature controls an aspect of Pine's message sending.  When enabled,
Pine will send a VERB (i.e., VERBose) command early in the posting process
intended to cause the server SMTP to provide a more detailed account of
the transaction.  This feature is typically only useful to system
administrators and other support personel as an aid in troublshooting
problems.

Note, this feature relies on a specific capability of the system's mail
transport agent or configured \"smtp-server\".  It is possible that this
feature will cause problems for some tranport agents, and may result in
sending failure.  In addition, as the verbose output comes from the mail
transport agent, it is likely to vary from one system to another. 

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_auto_reply_to =====
        FEATURE: reply-always-uses-reply-to

This feature controls an aspect of Pine's Reply command.  If set, Pine
will not prompt when a message being replied to contains a \"Reply-To:\"
header value, but will simply use its value (as opposed to using the
\"From:\" field's value).

Note: Using the \"Reply-To:\" address is usually the preferred behavior,
however, some mailing list managers choose to place the list's address in
the \"Reply-To:\" field of any message sent out to the list.  In such
cases, this feature makes it all too easy for personal replies to be
inadvertently sent to the entire mail list, so be careful!

====== h_config_auto_open_unread =====
          FEATURE: auto-open-next-unread

This feature controls the behavior of the TAB key when traversing folders
in the optional \"incoming-folders\" collection or in optional
\"news-collections\".  When the TAB (Next New) key is pressed, and there
are no more unseen messages in the current (incoming message or news)
folder, Pine will search the list of folders in the current collection for
one containing New or Recent (new since the last time the folder was
opened) messages.  Normally, when such a folder is found, Pine will ask
whether you wish to open the folder.  If this feature is set, Pine will
automatically open the folder without prompting.

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_auto_include_reply =====
          FEATURE: include-text-in-reply

This feature controls an aspect of Pine's Reply command.  Normally, Pine

====== h_config_select_in_bold =====
         FEATURE: show-selected-in-boldface

This feature controls an aspect of Pine's aggregate operation commands; in
particular, the Select and WhereIs commands. Select and WhereIs (with the
^X subcommand) will search the current folder for messages meeting a
specified criteria, and \"tag\" the resulting messages with an \"X\" in the
first column of the applicable lines in the FOLDER INDEX.  If this feature
is set, instead of using the \"X\" to denote a selected message, Pine will
attempt to display those index lines in boldface. Whether this is
preferable to the \"X\" will depend on personal taste and the type of
terminal being used.

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_folder_extension ======

Normally PC-Pine appends the extension \"MTX\" to all local (PC) folder
names and suppresses that extension when listing those folders.  By
setting this option, you override this behavior.  In particular, you may
set \"folder-extension\" to the \"null string\" which tells PC-Pine to
neither add nor hide-from-view *any* folder name extension.

The reason you might wish to override the MTX default is that recent
versions of PC-Pine have the ability to open (albeit READ-ONLY) normal
Unix mail folders. Since it might be inconvenient to rename all of them to
have an MTX extension, it is possible with this option to switch PC-Pine's
behavior so that such folders can be seen and accessed without changing
their names. However, doing this means that your existing PC-Pine local
folders will have apparently changed their names.  For example, if you had
a local folder named \"FOO\" it will now appear in the Folder List as
\"FOO.MTX\". If you wish to save additional messages to that folder, you
will need to enter the full name, \"FOO.MTX\" at the Save prompt.
Likewise for GOTO.

If you wish to permanently avoid having to deal with folder name extensions,
you will need to set this option to the null string by entering two double-
quote marks, and you will need to rename your existing local folders to
not have the MTX extension.  In DOS this can be done in one command, once
you have changed to your mail directory:  RENAME  *.MTX  *.

We don't know why you might wish to, but you could also use this option
to tell PC-Pine to use an extension other than MTX.  In this case, enter
the three characters you desire to use in lieu of \"MTX\".  Note that
your existing folders will need to be renamed to correspond to this new
extension.

====== h_config_quote_all_froms =====
        FEATURE: save-will-quote-leading-froms

This feature controls an aspect of the Save command (and also the way
outgoing messages are saved to an FCC folder).  If set, Pine will add
a leading \">\" character in front of message lines beginning with \"From
\" when they are saved to another folder, including lines syntactically
distinguishable from the type of message separator line commonly used on
Unix systems.

The default behavior is that a \">\" will be prepended only to lines
beginning with \"From \" that might otherwise be confused with a message
separator line on Unix systems.  If pine is the only mail program you use,
this default is reasonable.  If another program you use has trouble
displaying a message with an unquoted \"From \" saved by Pine, you should
enable this feature.  This feature only applies to the common Unix mailbox
format that uses message separator lines beginning with \"From \".  If
Pine has been configured to use a different mailbox format (possibly
incompatible with other mail programs), then this issue does not arise,
and the feature is irrelevant.

====== h_config_news_uses_recent ======
        FEATURE: news-approximates-new-status

This feature causes certain messages to be marked as \"New\" in the
Folder Index of news groups.

When opening a news group, Pine will consult your \"newsrc\" file and
determine the last message you have previously disposed of via the \"D\"
key.  If this feature is set, any subsequent messages will be shown in the
Index with an \"N\", and the first of these messages will be highlighted.
Although this is only an approximation of true \"New\" or \"unseen\"
status, it provides a useful cue to distinguish more-or-less recent
messages from those you have seen previously, but are not yet ready to
mark deleted.

Background: your \"newsrc\" file (used to store message status information
for news groups) is only capable of storing a single flag, and Pine uses
this to record whether or not you are \"done with\" a message, as
indicated by marking the message as \"Deleted\".  Unfortunately, this
means that Pine has no way to record exactly which messages you have
previously seen, so it normally does not show the \"N\" status flag for
any messages in a news group. This feature enables a starting
*approximation* of seen/unseen status that may be useful.

====== h_config_suspend_spawns =====
        FEATURE: use-subshell-for-suspend

This feature affects Pine's behavior when process suspension is enabled
and then activated via the Ctrl-Z key.  Pine suspension allows one to
temporarily interact with the operating system command \"shell\" without
quitting Pine, and then subsequently resume the still-active Pine session.

When the \"enable-suspend\" feature is set and subsequently the Ctrl-Z key
is pressed, Pine will normally suspend itself and return temporary control
to Pine's parent shell process.  However, if this feature is set, Pine
will instead create an inferior subshell process.  This is useful when the
parent process is not intended to be used interactively.  Examples include
invoking Pine via the -e argument of the Unix \"xterm\" program, or via a
menu system.

Note that one typically resumes a suspended Pine by entering the Unix
\"fg\"  command, but if this feature is set, it will be necessary to
enter the \"exit\" command instead.

====== h_config_8bit_smtp =====
        FEATURE: enable-8bit-to-smtp-server

This feature affects Pine's behavior when sending mail.  Internet standards
require that all electronic mail messages traversing the global Internet
consist of 7bit ASCII characters unless a pair of cooperating mail 
transfer agents explicitly agree to allow 8bit messages.  In general, 
then, exchanging messages in non-ASCII characters requires MIME encoding.

However, there are now Internet standards that allow for unencoded 8bit
exchange of messages between cooperating systems.  Setting this feature
tells Pine to try to negotiate unencoded 8bit transmission during the
sending process.  Should the negotiation fail, Pine will fall back to its
ordinary encoding rules. 

Note, this feature relies on your system's mail transport agent or
configured \"smtp-server\" having the negotiation mechanism introduced in
\"Extended SMTP\" (ESMTP) and the specific extension called \"8BITMIME\". 

ESMTP allows for graceful migration to upgraded mail transfer agents, but
it is possible that this feature might cause problems for some servers. 

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_8bit_nntp =====
        FEATURE: enable-8bit-nntp-posting

This feature affects Pine's behavior when posting news.  

The Internet standard for exchanging USENET news messages (RFC-1036)
specifies that USENET messages should conform to Internet mail standards
and contain only 7bit characters, but much of the news transport software
in use today is capable of successfully sending messages containing 8bit
characters.  Hence, many people believe that it is appropriate to send 8bit
news messages without any MIME encoding.

Moreover, there is no Internet standard for explicitly negotiating 8bit
transfer, as there is for Internet email.  Therefore, Pine provides the
option of posting unencoded 8bit news messages, though not as the default.
Setting this feature will turn OFF Pine's MIME encoding of newsgroup
postings that contain 8bit characters. 

Note, articles may cross a path or pass through news transport software
that is unsafe or even hostile to 8bit characters.  At best this will only
cause the posting to become garbled.  The safest way to transmit 8bit
characters is to leave Pine's MIME encoding turned on, but recipients
who lack MIME-aware tools are often annoyed when they receive MIME-encoded 
messages.

====== h_config_tab_new_only =====
        FEATURE: tab-visits-next-new-message-only

This feature affects Pine's behavior when using the TAB key to move from
one message to the next.  Pine's usual behavior is to select the next
unread message or message flagged as \"Important\".

Setting this feature causes Pine to skip the messages flagged as important,
and select unread messages exclusively.  Tab behavior when there are no
new messages left to select remains unchanged.

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_quell_dead_letter =====
        FEATURE: quell-dead-letter-on-cancel

This feature affects Pine's behavior when you cancel a message being
composed.  Pine's usual behavior is to write the canceled message to
a file named \"dead.letter\" in your home directory (under UNIX;
\"DEADLETR\" under WINDOWS/DOS) overwriting any previous message. Under
some conditions (some routine), this can introduce a noticeable delay.

Setting this feature will cause Pine NOT to write canceled compositions
into the file called dead.letter.

NOTE: Enabling this feature means NO record of canceled messages is
maintained.

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_quell_beeps =====
        FEATURE: quell-status-message-beeping

This feature affects Pine's behavior when it displays status message
(e.g., Error complaints, New mail warnings, etc).  Setting this feature
will not affect the display of such messages, but will cause those that
emit a beep to become silent.

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_quell_lock_failure_warnings =====
        FEATURE: quell-lock-failure-warnings

This feature affects Pine's behavior when it encounters a problem
acquiring a mail folder lock.  Typically, a secondary file associated
with the mail folder being opened is created as part of the locking
process.  On some systems, such file creation has been administratively
precluded by the system configuration.

Pine issues a warning when such failures occur which can become bothersome
if the system is configured to disallow such actions.  Setting this
feature causes Pine to remain silent when this part of lock creation fails.

WARNING: systems that have been configured in a way that precludes locking
introduce some risk of mail folder corruption when more than one program
attempts to modify the mail folder.  This is most likely to occur to one's
INBOX or other incoming message folder. 


<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_cruise_mode =====
        FEATURE: enable-cruise-mode

This feature affects Pine's behavior when you hit the \"Space Bar\" at
the end of a displayed message.  Typically, Pine complains that the end
of the text has already been reached.  Setting this feature causes such
keystrokes to be interpreted as if the \"Tab\" key had been hit, thus
taking you to the next \"interesting\" message, or scanning ahead to the 
next incoming folder with \"interesting\" messages.


<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_cruise_mode_delete =====
        FEATURE: enable-cruise-mode-delete

This feature modifies the behavior of Pine's \"enable-cruise-mode\"
feature.  Setting this feature causes pine to implicitly delete read
messages when it moves on to display the next \"Interesting\" message.

NOTE: Beware when enabling this feature AND the \"expunge-without-confirm\"
feature.

<End of help on this topic>
====== h_config_allow_goto =====
        FEATURE: enable-goto-in-file-browser

This feature modifies the behavior of Pine's file browser.  Setting this
feature causes Pine to offer the \"G Goto\" command in the file browser.

This command allows you to explicitly set the displayed directory.  Pine's
default behavior requires you to visit each related directory when between
two distant directories.
