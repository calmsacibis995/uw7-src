 * NOTES:
 *
 *	This files describes the key bindings for pico and the pine 
 *      composer.  The binds are static, (i.e., no way for the user
 *      to change them) so as to keep pico/composer as simple to use
 *      as possible.  This, of course, means the number of functions is
 *      greatly reduced, but, then again, this is seen as very desirable.
 *
 *      There are very limited number of flat ctrl-key bindings left, and 
 *      most of them are slated for yet-to-be implemented functions, like
 *      invoking an alternate editor in the composer and necessary funcs
 *      for imlementing attachment handling.  We really want to avoid 
 *      going to multiple keystroke functions. -mss
