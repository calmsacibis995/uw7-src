POP Server Test Suite

1. Introduction.

The test suite for the rfc1725 compliant POP server is described in
this document.  Each test case  is described, and the test case numbers
correspond to the test case numbers in the test suite code.

2. Architecture.

The test suite is a shell script and a single binary that talks to the
POP server through sockets.   The test suite avoids looking at
mailboxes by using the IMAP server to verify and manage  mailbox contents.

The reasoning is that the underlying mailbox storage format is subject
to change as it is hidden  under the c-client library.  The c-client
library has it's own tests for the message stores, so we do 
not need to test at that level.

Unlike the imap server, the POP server needs to be run from inetd,
so a small program called socket is used to allow the pop server's
stdin and stdout to become stdin and stdout of a program 
that can be called from a shell script (socket).

3. POP Test Cases.

3.1 POP Manual Test Cases.

o - Using a prefered POP client of the time (Eudora or Netscape as of
    this writing), connect to the POP server over the network, login,
    and read some mail.  Preferably try both UNIX and Windows based clients

o - Fire up a POP client, open INBOX, send some message to yourself, check
    for new mail, vfy that it comes in and that the new flag is set on
    the new messages.

o - Test that the POP server correctly identifies a multihome user
    and gets to their mailbox, check the correct passwd is used as well.


3.2 POP Primitives.

The following primitives are listed in rfc1725:

  USER
  PASS
  QUIT
  STAT
  LIST
  RETR
  DELE

Optional primitives are:

  TOP
  UIDL
  APOP

APOP is not tested, all other primitives are tested.

3.3 Automated Test Cases.

The POP primitives are tested in the order they are listed in rfc1725.
This is not an exhaustive test by any means, but every primitive and
its basic functionality are tested.  The purpose here is less of a POP
protocol test and more of an integration test between the POP server and
our c-client modifications on the back end.

Pop1 - Just login and logout as our user.
Pop2 - STAT and LIST inbox.
Pop3 - RETR all messages.
Pop4 - DELE all messages, STAT and LIST again.
Pop5 - TOP 0 all messages, get just the headers.
Pop6 - UIDL all messages.
