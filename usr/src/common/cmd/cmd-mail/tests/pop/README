POP 3 (rfc1725) automated test suite.

pop:	the test script

The program wants to run as a normal user. It uses the IMAP4 server
to set up and manage the inbox (to divorce us from mailbox formats).
It will prompt for the password for the user you are using.

It expects /etc/imapd to be where the imap server lives.
It expects /etc/popper to be where the pop server lives.

To run, type pop, you must have '.' in your path.

The output is pretty self explanatory as each test outputs
either PASS or FAIL to stdout.  Failures of course will require
examining the test source.
