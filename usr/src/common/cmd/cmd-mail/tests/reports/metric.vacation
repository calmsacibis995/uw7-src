3 bugs were found and fixed.
12 changes were made.
461 lines of C source code were developed.
736 lines of test code (all sh) were developed.
11 test cases were developed.
96% statement coverage was achieved using fully automated testing.
6 bugs/KLOC (bugs per thousand lines of code) were discovered.
25 diffs/KLOC (diffs per thousand lines of code) were created.

1 days were spent on the design.
1 days were spent to implement the design.
2.5 days were spent in testing (developing the suite and fixing the bugs found).

Analysis:

Significantly less (about half) bugs/KLOC were discovered than our usual
10-15%.  This is because this program was based on a previous incarnation
of vacation from OSR5.  In other words, only about half the code was new.
