The rmt test cases are a stand-alone package to achieve 100% branch coverage
on the host.tcl file, it also provokes remote paths for main.tcl and
objedit.tcl that were not covered by other test cases.

Configuration:
Set .hosts equivalence on the remote host for both root and owner.:
	/.rhosts /home/owner/.rhosts

The semi-automated test cases are as follows:

rmt_test1:
	This test runs as root and opens the remote host.
	Host->Open remote host, cancel out of dialog.
	Host->Open remote host, use the select button to find your host.
	Change mail comes from.
	Exit->save changes.
rmt_test2:
	This test runs as owner without owner permissions on the
	remote machine.
	Host->Open remote host.
		should fail to open the remote host.
	Exit->no save.
rmt_test3:
	This test runs as bin, should not be authorized.
	Answer ok to the error box.
rmt_test4:
	This test runs as owner to test remote tfadmin.
	Host->Open remote host.
	Add a new channel, use defaults.
		Should get warning box that channel program does not exist.
	Change channel pgm runs as (in the new channel) user to bin.
	Change channel pgm runs as (in the new channel) group to bin.
	Using the channel table editor, create the table file.
	Exit->save changes.
rmt_test5:
	This test runs as owner to test local tfadmin.
	Add a new channel, use defaults.
		Should get warning box that channel program does not exist.
	Change channel pgm runs as (in the new channel) user to bin.
	Change channel pgm runs as (in the new channel) group to bin.
	Using the channel table editor, create the table file.
