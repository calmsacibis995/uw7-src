#ident "@(#)mag.plan	11.2"

Test runs as root, wants to write to /etc/default/mail and /etc/sendmail.cf.

A little on the architecure of these test cases.

core is our basic feature testing set.

Each of the following test case sets depend only on core and will
cover the rest of the the branches for the source files in their domain.

object and objedit must be run in series and will cover
	all of object and objedit (minus the -h branch for edittors).
main is a little special in it will only cover
	the parts of main that are not covered elsewhere.
utils is similar in that it only covers branches missed elsewhere.
bad covers the entire bad.tcl file, no dependencies.
flags covers the entire flags.tcl file, no dependencies.
chadd covers chadd.tcl and is dependent on core to achieve complete coverage.


The semi-automated test cases are as follows:

core_test1:	For each folder:
			Expand the folder.
			Select Settings->Defaults.
			Close the folder.
			Do the channels inside the channel folder first:
				Expand, default, close.
			Then default the channels folder and close it.
			Answer yes to each defaults question.
		Host->Exit.
		Save changes.

core_test2:	Add a new map "/tmp/aliases",
			use the add toolbar button.
			Use the "move dn" button to move /tmp/aliases down.
			Hit the button twice. the second time no moves occur.
		Add two new altnames "myothername" and "myothername2"
			Use the Edit->Add menu.
			Use "move up" button to move myothername up.
			Hit the button twice, the second time no moves occur.
		Add a new channel named newchan,
			program is /tmp/deliver
			table type is file.
			Answer yes to continue, /tmp/deliver not exist.
		Host->Exit
		Save changes.

core_test3:	Delete map "/tmp/aliases" using delete toolbar button.
