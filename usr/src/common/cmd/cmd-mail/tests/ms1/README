Message store version 1.0 automated test suite.

ms1:	the Message Store vsn 1 Test script
ms1tb:	the Message Store vsn 1 Test binary (called by the script).

ms1tb links to libc-client.so.

The program wants to run as a normal user.

The environment variables HOME and USER are used (which are normally set).

The test suite also wants write permission to /etc/default/mail so
you must make /etc/default/mail writable by the user you use to
run the test suite.

To run, first run make, then type ms1, you must have '.' in your path.

The output is almost self explanatory as each test outputs
either PASS or FAIL to stdout.  Failures of course will require
examining the test source.

To run on OSR5 give the argument OSR5 to the script "ms1 OSR5"
