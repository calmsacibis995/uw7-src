The mail test package include the following Word 95 format documents:

mail.doc     (Revision 5 of the UNIX Mail Test Specification)
binmail.doc  (/bin/mail Front End Test Specification)
mailx.doc    (/bin/mailx Front End Test Specification)
metamail.doc (The Metamail Test Specification)
mailr.doc    (The MailR Test Specification)

The UNIX Mail Test Spec (mail.doc) is the master document for all mail testing.
It  references all other test specs dealing with UNIX mail (but not MHS or
dtmail). This is the docuent you start with to test mail.  It will direct the
tester  when to consult other mail component test specs.  Most test are
interactive. All automated tests are installed with the mail test package
(mtest). Mtest is localted in the /PRVTESTS/UTA_Tests/pkgs directory on this
system.  Mtest is in pkgadd format and requires UTA and ETET installed on the
system. Mtest has automated tests for the following components:

mailx
mailR
Mail Stress and Reliablility Tests (domail)
mail security
/bin/mail (This is still under construction. Only 20% of the tests are 
           automated.)

The UNIX Mail Test Specification describes how to setup and run the manual
and automated tests, or guides the tester to the correct mail component spec 
for information.
