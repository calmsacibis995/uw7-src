IMAP 4 (rfc1730) automated test suite.

imap:	the test script

The program wants to run as a normal user.

It expects /etc/imapd to be where the imap server lives.

To run, type imap, you must have '.' in your path.

The output is pretty self explanatory as each test outputs
either PASS or FAIL to stdout.  Failures of course will require
examining the test source.
