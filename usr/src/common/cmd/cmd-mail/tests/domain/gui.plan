		Mail Admin GUI : Domain Table Client
		     Test Plan for GUI portions
		------------------------------------

This is the test plan for the domain table editor client of the mail admin 
GUI.  The goal of this test plan is to achieve 100% branch coverage of tcl 
source files for the domain table editor.  Since a command line interface for 
the editor does not exist, the gui can only be manually tested.  However, this 
test plan implements the idea of "semi-automation", meaning that scripts do 
the set up and comparison of files, but the GUI steps must still be executed 
manually according to a script.

Setup and Execution:

1) The env variable TESTDIR may be set to the directory in which the test
   script "gui" will exist and be run, and where input and output files
   for "gui" will exist.  If TESTDIR is not set in your env, the script will
   by default set it to the current working directory.  The following files
   are expected to exist in $TESTDIR:
        $TESTDIR/testfiles/domain.1
        $TESTDIR/testfiles/domain.2
        $TESTDIR/testfiles/domain.3

2) Set env variable PROGDIR to the directory in which the "domain"
   executable exists.  If PROGDIR is not set in your env, this script
   will by default set it to /etc/mail/admin.

   The "domain" executable should be the instrumented version if you would
   like to determine code coverage of the domain client:
         a) do a 'make domaint' of the domain source
         b) copy executable "domaint" to $PROGDIR/domain

3) Run the script "gui" as root to invoke the tests.
   Test results will be sent to stdout.
   If a test case fails, a prompt will be displayed on stdout, asking the
   tester if he/she wishes to re-execute this test-- this is in the event
   that the tester believes that the failure may be due to incorrect
   execution of the test steps.

4) To obtain branch coverage results, execute the following steps:
        a) Execution of the "gui" script will have created many
           files of the form trace.* into $TESTDIR.
        b) Copy all *.tclt files from the src directory (generated by the 
	   make of domaint) into the $TESTDIR directory.
        c) Execute the "do_merge" script, which will output coverage results
           to stdout, and also create files of the form *.tclt.a.  These
           *.tclt.a files are annotated versions of the source files--
           lines beginning with a ">_branch" in these files mark unexecuted
           branches.
