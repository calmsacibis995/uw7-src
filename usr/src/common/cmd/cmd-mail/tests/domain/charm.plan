		Mail Admin GUI : Domain Table Client
		     Test Plan for CHARM portions
		------------------------------------

This is the test plan for the domain table editor client of the mail admin 
GUI, specific to the CHARM portions of the code.  The goal of this test plan,
in conjunction with the "gui.plan", is to achieve 100% branch coverage of tcl 
source files for the domain table editor.  

Since a command line interface for the editor does not exist, the gui can 
only be manually tested.  However, this test plan implements the idea of 
"semi-automation", meaning that a shell script does the set up and comparison
of files, but the GUI steps must still be executed manually according to a 
script of instructions.

The test cases and instructions outlined later below are a subset of the
test cases in gui.plan (for the gui portions), worded slightly differently
for CHARM navigation.  Only a subset of the gui test cases were necessary
to achieve complete branch coverage, as the CHARM specific portions are
mostly due to differences in display, not functionality.

Setup and Execution:

1) The env variable TESTDIR may be set to the directory in which the test
   script "charm" will exist and be run, and where input and output files
   for "charm" will exist.  If TESTDIR is not set in your env, the script will
   by default set it to the current working directory.  The following files
   are expected to exist in $TESTDIR:
        $TESTDIR/testfiles/domain.1
        $TESTDIR/testfiles/domain.2
        $TESTDIR/testfiles/domain.3

2) Set env variable PROGDIR to the directory in which the "domain"
   executable exists.  If PROGDIR is not set in your env, this script
   will by default set it to /etc/mail/admin.

   The "domain" executable should be the instrumented version if you would
   like to determine code coverage of the domain client:
         a) do a 'make domaint' of the domain source
         b) copy executable "domaint" to $PROGDIR/domain

3) Run the script "charm" as root to invoke the tests, and follow the plan
   below to execute the necessary steps.  For each case, the script will
   invoke the domain table editor in CHARM in a separate xterm.  Test results 
   will be sent to stdout.  If a test case fails, a prompt will be displayed 
   on stdout, asking the tester if he/she wishes to re-execute this test-- 
   this is in the event that the tester believes that the failure may be due 
   to incorrect execution of the test steps.

4) To obtain complete branch coverage results, execute the gui.plan test plan,
   as well as this one, before doing the following steps:
        a) Execution of both the "gui" and "charm" scripts will have created 
	   many files of the form trace.* into $TESTDIR.
        b) Copy all *.tclt files from the src directory (generated by the 
	   make of domaint) into the $TESTDIR directory.
        c) Execute the "do_merge" script, which will output coverage results
           to stdout, and also create files of the form *.tclt.a.  These
           *.tclt.a files are annotated versions of the source files--
           lines beginning with a ">_branch" in these files mark unexecuted
           branches.


The test cases, and step by step instructions, are as follows:

1. Add a new entry (domain_gui_core_entry_add):
	- Select the entry with "foo.pdev.sco.com" under the "Host" column.
	  (You will also have to deselect the entry for "spam.pdev.sco.com".)

		  field.
