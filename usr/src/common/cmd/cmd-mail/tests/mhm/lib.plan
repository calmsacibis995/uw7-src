Test suite for the libmultihome.a library.
This library depends on libdb.
Test does not need to be run as root if you make /var/internet writeable
by the user you run the test as.

test cases:

core_users: fetch some virtual users, to fetch one item that is not there.
core_domains: test if some virtual domains exist or not.
core_names: look up some names from ip addresses.
