#ident "@(#)admincmd.plan	11.2"

This script expects the test version (multihomet) to be installed
in /etc/mail/admin/multihome.

Also, the first virtual domain (see the config vars in the test script)
must be in DNS and aliased in TCP.

Test runs as root, or alternatively /var/internet can be made writable
to the test user (don't forget to put it back).

The automated test cases are as follows:

core: our core set of functional tests, test basic positive functionality.

core_usage:	execute our usage message routine.
core_listd:	list some test domains.
core_listu:	list users in a test domain.
core_delu:	delete a user from a domain.
core_addu:	add a user to a domain.
core_aget:	get an alias file.
core_aput:	put an alias file, update the db.
core_rebuild:	rebuild the domains database.

cmd_list1:	invalid list type.
cmd_del1:	user not found for delete.
cmd_add1:	add an existing user (clash).
cmd_aget1:	get a non-existant alias file.
cmd_aput1:	put an alias file, makemap does not work.
cmd_aput2:	put an alias file, copy out of alias file fails.
cmd_aput3:	put an alias file, copy out of alias.db file fails.
cmd_arg:	not enough arguments for command.
cmd_md1:	Can't automatically make multihome directory (is a file).
cmd_dom:	pass invalid domain to list.
cmd_put1:	save fails.
cmd_put2:	copyout fails.
cmd_put3:	makemap fails.
cmd_put4:	db copyout fails.

mh_op1:		open then reopen (like remote host).
mh_op2:		open fails.
mh_op3:		not two tokens on a line generates parse errors.
mh_op4:		null domain or no @, parserr.
mh_op5:		multiple @ chars, parserr.
mh_wr1:		write open fails.
