#ident "@(#)mailer.plan	11.1"
Automated test suite for the multihome mailer program.

Setup:
The configuration in /var/internet/ip is handled automatically
via the test suite.  No virtual domains need be added to the TCP/IP stack.
Mail admin GUI needs to be run to enable the multihome channel.
Test wants to be run as root.

If you want code coverage measurements install the instrumented binary
"multihomet" in /etc/mail/multihome.
Only test* test cases should be run on an instrumented binary as the
real* test cases will execute the mailer in sendmail's queue directory
and leave trace files there.

Execution:
run the shell script called "mailer" in this directory.

Coverage anaylysis:
run the shell script mailer.rpt to merge the .cnt files into one
and to generate a report.
