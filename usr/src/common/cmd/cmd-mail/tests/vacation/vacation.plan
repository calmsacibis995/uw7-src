Automated test suite for the vacation program.

Setup:
Test needs to be run as root.
The USER= variable needs to be set to the test user before the script is run.

this test to fail in strange ways.

"vacationt" in /usr/bin/vacation.

Execution:
run the shell script called "vacation" in this directory.

Coverage anaylysis:
run the shell script vacation.rpt to merge the .cnt files into one
