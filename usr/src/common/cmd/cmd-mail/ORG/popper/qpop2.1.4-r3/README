The qualcomm popper2.1.4-r3 is the source base for the atlas popper
which we are including in Gemini.

	Popper version qpop2.1.4-r3.tar.Z is the latest official release of
    the Qualcomm popper.  I have been working on subsequent versions since
    then and am finally close to releasing the next version 2.2.  What you
    see here is the 5th beta of that version.  I'm not asking for new
    features (which has delayed this release many months).  What I do want
    are bug reports on operational and installation issues.  Please send
    your comments to qpopper@qualcomm.com.  I hope to release 2.2 officially
    by the end of April.  I hope to get two more beta versions out between
    now and the end of April.

	You can send feature requests to qpopper@qualcomm.com but I won't
    be adding very much between now and the release.
