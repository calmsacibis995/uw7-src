mh, the RAND mail system, now supported by University of California Irvine.
The only component of it we wanted was slocal, an MMDF compatible
mail delivery program that can be called from a sendmail .forward file.

We plan to modify it once to use the C-Client interface and keep it forever.

I got it from

ftp.ics.edu/pub/mh/mh-6_8_tar.Z

in the MH configuration file (conf/MH) I set
	bin to /usr/bin
	mail to /var/mail
	etc to /etc/mail
	options to SYS5
	bboards to off
Then I ran the config program (in conf/)
	in conf/ run make (add -DSYS5 to CFLAGS first)
	then run "mhconfig MH".

All I got from this was the set of defines to use on the command line.
Some more work was needed to get it to compile.
