@(#)README	11.1

IMAP stuff comes from ftp.cac.washington.edu.

This port is the rfc1730 compliant version.
It should support IMAP2, IMAP2bis, and IMAP4.
Although IMAP2bis may be a bit broken.

The initial port contains the unix mbox driver
and the unix news driver only.

New ports will be very easy.  The only
strange thing I did was to extract the files from
their directory structure into a this directory.

All files were copied from files of the same name
except osdep.h was copied from os_sv4.h.

To re-port, just copy in the new files (by hand)
and recompile. It should just work, right? :-)

Change history for imap server:

Mark Crispin should get these
mods at some point.

Linkage.c and .h were the generated ones from
	"make uw2".  To get make uw2 to work I had to modify
	the tools makefile to add the - "-rm -f *.o"
	and make the below mentioned mod to os_sv4.h (osdep.h)
	for const to memmove.

osdep.h memmove define line 84 added const keyword.

bezerk.c line 994 remove 'O' status, as we wish to use
	append for local mail delivery.
