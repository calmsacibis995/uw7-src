#ident "@(#)README	11.1"

Our multihoming support is all in this directory except
for the modifications to popper and imapd.

Our design is as follows:

There are four components to multihoming support:

o - Admin tool (/etc/mail/admin/mhome) to edit /usr/lib/internet/virtusers[.db].
    This tool also calls the alias editor for each virtual domain.
o - /etc/mail/multihome mailer to be used in the multihome channel.
o - Multihome API for popper and IMAP and others /usr/lib/libmhome.so.
o - Popper and imapd servers are modified to use the multihome API.

mhome.doc describes the design in more detail.
