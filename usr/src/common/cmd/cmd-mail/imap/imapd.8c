IMAPd \- Internet Message Access Protocol server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /usr/etc/imapd
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I imapd
is a server which supports the
.B IMAP4
remote mail access protocol as documented in RFC-1730.
.I imapd
is invoked by the internet server (see
.IR inetd (8)),
normally for requests to connect to the
.B IMAP4
port as indicated by the
.I /etc/services
file (see
.IR services (5)).
Normally, this is port 143.
.PP
.I imapd
can also be accessed via
.IR rsh (1C)
by many Unix-based clients.  To do this, the
.I imapd
binary must have a link to
.I /etc/rimapd
since this is where this software expects it to be located.
