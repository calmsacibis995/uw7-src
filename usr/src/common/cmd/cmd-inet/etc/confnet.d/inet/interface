#
#Field	Name		Verify	Purpose			Default on NULL
#
#$1	prefix		string	device identifier	NONE
#	prefix is an identifier for a driver's netstat statistics
#
#$2	unit		number	device ifstats index	NONE
#	unit is the index per prefix array
#
#$3	address		NONE	IP name or address	`/usr/bin/uname -n`
#	address is used by ifconfig to initialize the transport provider.
#	This may be the internet name or number.
#	Null is expanded to `/usr/bin/uname -n`
#
#$4	device		string	full device path name	NONE
#	device is the node name of the transport provider.
#	it is reserved through the generic /etc/confnet.d/configure script
#	from the generic /etc/confnet.d/netdrivers file.
#	it will be used by slink
#
#$5	ifconfig_opt	NONE	allow customized options, SLIP for example
#	ifconfig_opts is used to customize the ifconfig options used at boot time.
#	The constructed command line will take the form:
#		ifconfig prefixunit# Converted_Address ifconfig_opts up
#	Converted_Address is the /etc/inet/hosts value for the address field.
#	So ifconfig_opts has the -trailers and other options needed by
#	System V Release 4 transport providers. 
#	Note that a null entry is allowed for providers like lo0 that require
#	no additional ifconfig options at boot time. 
#
#$6	slink_opt	NONE	allow customized options, SLIP for example
#	default:	add_interface
#	The slink_opts value is used by slink to initialize the device
#	into the TCP/IP protocol stack.
#	slink_opts selects the strcf function from /etc/inet/strcf and
#	any initial arguments.
#	add_interface is the default slink_opts value; it is used with
#	Ethernet-style devices.
#	Additional arguments will be appended to slink_opt to make the final
#	form of the slink operation:
#		slink_opts ip device prefixunit#
#	Where ip will be an open file descriptor to /dev/ip and device prefix
#	and unit are defined in the current interface entry.
#	For a standard Ethernet board, slink_opts may be null; the defaults
#	will take care of all arguments.
