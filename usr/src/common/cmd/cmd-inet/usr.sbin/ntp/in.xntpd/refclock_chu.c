/*
 * The CHU time signal includes a time code which is modulated at the
 * standard Bell 103 frequencies (i.e. mark=2225Hz, space=2025Hz).
 * and formatted into 8 bit characters with one start bit and two
 * stop bits. The time code is composed of 10 8-bit characters.
 * The second 5 bytes of the timecode are a redundancy check, and
 * are a copy of the first 5 bytes.
 *
 * It is assumed that you have built or modified a Bell 103 standard
 * modem, attached the input to the output of a radio and cabled the
 * output to a serial port on your computer, i.e. what you are receiving
 * is essentially the output of your radio.  It is also assumed you have
 * installed a special CHU line discipline to condition the output from
 * the terminal driver and take accurate time stamps.
 *
 * There are two types of timecodes. One is sent in the 32nd
 * through 39th second of the minute.
 *
 *     6dddhhmmss6dddhhmmss
 *
 * where ddd is the day of the year, hh is the hour (in UTC), mm is
 * the minute and ss the second.  The 6 is a constant.  Note that
 * the code is sent twice.
 *
 * The second sort of timecode is sent only during the 31st second
 * past the minute.
 *
 *     xdyyyyttabXDYYYYTTAB
 *
 * In this case, the second part of the code is the one's complement
 * of the code. This differentiates it from the other timecode
 * format.
 *
 * d is the absolute value of DUT (in tenths of a second). yyyy
 * is the year. tt is the difference between UTC and TAI. a is
 * a canadian daylight time flag and b is a serial number.
 * x is a bitwise field. The least significant bit of x is
 * one if DUT is negative. The 2nd bit is set if a leap second
 * will be added at the next opportunity. The 3rd bit is set if
 * a leap second will be deleted at the next opportunity.
 * The 4th bit is an even parity bit for the other three bits
 * in this nibble.
 *
 * The start bit in each character has a precise relationship to
 * the on-time second. Most often UART's synchronize themselves to the
 * start bit and will post an interrupt at the center of the first stop
 * bit.  Thus each character's interrupt should occur at a fixed offset
 * from the on-time second. This means that a timestamp taken at the
 * arrival of each character in the code will provide an independent
 * estimate of the offset.  Since there are 10 characters in the time
 * code and the code is sent 9 times per minute, this means you
 * potentially get 90 offset samples per minute. Much of the code in
 * here is dedicated to producing a single offset estimate from these
 * samples.
 *
 * A note about the line discipline. It is possible to receive the
 * CHU time code in raw mode, but this has disadvantages. In particular,
 * this puts a lot of code between the interrupt and the time you freeze
 * a time stamp, decreasing precision. It is also expensive in terms of
 * context switches, and made even more expensive by the way I do I/O.
 * Worse, since you are listening directly to the output of your radio,
 * CHU is noisy and will make you spend a lot of time receiving noise.
 *
 * The line discipline fixes a lot of this. It knows that the CHU time
 * code consists of 10 bytes which arrive with an intercharacter
 * spacing of about 37 ms, and that the data is BCD, and filters on this
 * basis. It delivers block of ten characters plus their associated time
 * stamps all at once. The time stamps are hence about as accurate as
 * a Unix machine can get them, and much of the noise disappears in the
 * kernel with no context switching cost.
 *
 * The kernel module also will insure that the packets that are
 * delivered have the correct redundancy bytes, and will return
 * a flag in chutype to differentiate one sort of packet from
 * the other.
