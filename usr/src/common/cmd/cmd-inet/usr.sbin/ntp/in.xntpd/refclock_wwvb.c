/*
 * This driver supports the Spectracom Model 8170 and Netclock/2 WWVB
 * Synchronized Clock. This clock has proven a reliable source of time,
 * except in some cases of high ambient conductive RF interference. The
 * claimed accuracy of the clock is 100 usec relative to the broadcast
 * signal; however, in most cases the actual accuracy is limited by the
 * precision of the timecode and the latencies of the serial interface
 * and operating system.
 *
 * The DIPswitches on this clock should be set to 24-hour display, AUTO
 * DST off, time zone 0 (UTC), data format 0 or 2 (see below) and baud
 * rate 9600. If this clock is to used as the source for the IRIG Audio
 * Decoder (refclock_irig.c in this distribution), set the DIPswitches
 * for AM IRIG output and IRIG format 1 (IRIG B with signature control).
 *
 * There are two timecode formats used by these clocks. Format 0, which
 * is available with both the Netclock/2 and 8170, and format 2, which
 * is available only with the Netclock/2 and specially modified 8170.
 *
 * Format 0 (22 ASCII printing characters):
 *
 * <cr><lf>i  ddd hh:mm:ss  TZ=zz<cr><lf>
 *
 *	on-time = first <cr> *	hh:mm:ss = hours, minutes, seconds
 *	i = synchronization flag (' ' = in synch, '?' = out of synch)
 *
 * The alarm condition is indicated by other than ' ' at A, which occurs
 * during initial synchronization and when received signal is lost for
 * about ten hours.
 *
 * Format 2 (24 ASCII printing characters):
 *
 * <cr><lf>iqyy ddd hh:mm:ss.fff ld
 *
 *	on-time = <cr>
 *	i = synchronization flag (' ' = in synch, '?' = out of synch)
 *	q = quality indicator (' ' = locked, 'A'...'D' = unlocked)
 *	yy = year (as broadcast)
 *	ddd = day of year
 *	hh:mm:ss.fff = hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds
 *
 * The alarm condition is indicated by other than ' ' at A, which occurs
 * during initial synchronization and when received signal is lost for
 * about ten hours. The unlock condition is indicated by other than ' '
 * at Q.
 *
 * The Q is normally ' ' when the time error is less than 1 ms and a
 * character in the set 'A'...'D' when the time error is less than 10,
 * 100, 500 and greater than 500 ms respectively. The L is normally ' ',
 * but is set to 'L' early in the month of an upcoming UTC leap second
 * and reset to ' ' on the first day of the following month. The D is
 * set to 'S' for standard time 'I' on the day preceding a switch to
 * daylight time, 'D' for daylight time and 'O' on the day preceding a
 * switch to standard time. The start bit of the first <cr> is
 * synchronized to the indicated time as returned.
 *
 * This driver does not need to be told which format is in use - it
 * figures out which one from the length of the message. A three-stage
 * median filter is used to reduce jitter and provide a dispersion
 * measure. The driver makes no attempt to correct for the intrinsic
 * jitter of the radio itself, which is a known problem with the older
 * radios.
 *
 * Fudge Factors
 *
 * This driver can retrieve a table of quality data maintained
 * internally by the Netclock/2 receiver. If flag4 of the fudge
 * configuration command is set to 1, the driver will retrieve this
 * table and write it to the clockstats file on when the first timecode
 * message of a new day is received.
