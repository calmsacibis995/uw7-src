/*
 * This driver supports the Heath GC-1000 Most Accurate Clock, with
 * RS232C Output Accessory. This is a WWV/WWVH receiver somewhat less
 * robust than other supported receivers. Its claimed accuracy is 100 ms
 * when actually synchronized to the broadcast signal, but this doesn't
 * happen even most of the time, due to propagation conditions, ambient
 * noise sources, etc. When not synchronized, the accuracy is at the
 * whim of the internal clock oscillator, which can wander into the
 * sunset without warning. Since the indicated precision is 100 ms,
 * expect a host synchronized only to this thing to wander to and fro,
 * occasionally being rudely stepped when the offset exceeds the default
 * CLOCK_MAX of 128 ms. 
 *
 * The internal DIPswitches should be set to operate at 1200 baud in
 * MANUAL mode and the current year. The external DIPswitches should be
 * set to GMT and 24-hour format, or to the host local time zone (with
 * DST) and 12-hour format. It is very important that the year be
 * set correctly in the DIPswitches. Otherwise, the day of year will be
 * incorrect after 28 April[?] of a normal or leap year.  In 12-hour mode
 * with DST selected the clock will be incorrect by an hour for an
 * indeterminate amount of time between 0000Z and 0200 on the day DST
 * changes.
 *
 * In MANUAL mode the clock responds to a rising edge of the request to
 * send (RTS) modem control line by sending the timecode. Therefore, it
 * is necessary that the operating system implement the TIOCMBIC and
 * TIOCMBIS ioctl system calls and TIOCM_RTS control bit. Present
 * restrictions require the use of a POSIX-compatible programming
 * interface, although other interfaces may work as well.
 *
 * A simple hardware modification to the clock can be made which
 * prevents the clock hearing the request to send (RTS) if the HI SPEC
 * lamp is out. Route the HISPEC signal to the tone decoder board pin
 * 19, from the display, pin 19. Isolate pin 19 of the decoder board
 * first, but maintain connection with pin 10. Also isolate pin 38 of
 * the CPU on the tone board, and use half an added 7400 to gate the
 * original signal to pin 38 with that from pin 19.
 *
 * The clock message consists of 23 ASCII printing characters in the
 * following format:
 *
 * hh:mm:ss.f AM  dd/mm/yr<cr>
 *
 *	hh:mm:ss.f = hours, minutes, seconds
 *	f = deciseconds ('?' when out of spec)
 *	AM/PM/bb = blank in 24-hour mode
 *	dd/mm/yr = day, month, year
 *
 * The alarm condition is indicated by '?', rather than a digit, at f.
 * Note that 0?:??:??.? is displayed before synchronization is first
 * established and hh:mm:ss.? once synchronization is established and
 * then lost again for about a day.
 *
 * Fudge Factors
 *
 * A fudge time1 value of .04 s appears to center the clock offset
 * residuals. The fudge time2 parameter is the local time offset east of
 * Greenwich, which depends on DST. Sorry about that, but the clock
 * gives no hint on what the DIPswitches say.
