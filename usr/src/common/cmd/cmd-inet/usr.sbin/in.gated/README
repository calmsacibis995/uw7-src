GateD R3-5-7 public domain software is provided by Merit
(previously provided via Cornell University).

http://www.gated.merit.edu/
ftp://ftp.gated.merit.edu/net-research/gated/gated-R3_5_7.tar.gz

The Config file used to generate the GateD source is kept here for
future reference.

The VERSION file holds the version of GateD (currectly 3-5-7;
GateD in OSR5 is R3_0_3, and R2_0 in UW 2.1.?)

Modified code is marked with #define SCO_[GEMINI|OSR5|UW21]

Modifications required to run on Gemini:

CODE CARRIED FORWARD FROM OSR5 STREAMware GateD (R3_0_3)
-----------------------------------------------
usr/src/common/cmd/cmd-inet/usr.sbin/in.gated/krt_rtread_kinfo.c
	-  read kernel routing table via ioctl RTSTR_GETROUTE
	  (largely re-written not marked as SCO_GEMINI)
usr/src/common/cmd/cmd-inet/usr.sbin/in.gated/krt.c
usr/src/common/cmd/cmd-inet/usr.sbin/in.gated/krt_rt_sock.c
	- krt.c
	  open /dev/route for kernel routing table modifications.
	- krt_rt_sock.c
	  use RTSTR_SEND to update the kernel routing table.

(usr/src/common/cmd/cmd-inet/usr.sbin/in.gated/krt_ifread_ioctl.c)
usr/src/common/cmd/cmd-inet/usr.sbin/in.gated/krt_ifread_kinfo.c
	- krt_ifread_ioctl.c
	  use another socket to read interface list, do not use
	  task_get_socket() if TASKS_TEST is set, otherwise
	  -C|-c command line options will fail.


FIXES REQUIRED TO RUN ON Gemini / UW 2.1.?
------------------------------------------
usr/src/common/cmd/cmd-inet/usr.sbin/in.gated/bgp_init.c
	- gated only sets IP_TOS on the receiving connect() end.
	  The kernel tcp_linput() will dropwithreset if tos is set
	  but does not match the incoming packet.  Unfortunately,
	  we cannot set TOS on sending end, as existing systems
	  running gated will not set TOS, resulting in a dropwithreset...
	  So, do not use socket option IP_TOS on UW systems.
	  Note that ospf_init.c sets IP_TOS correctly in ospf_startup()

usr/src/common/cmd/cmd-inet/usr.sbin/in.gated/bgp_init.c
usr/src/common/cmd/cmd-inet/usr.sbin/in.gated/ospf_rxmon.c
	- added bgp_do_connect() to establish a non-blocking connect(),
	  The gated code assumed that a connection is established
	  when a select() returns in task.c, causing bgp connections
	  to fail.

usr/src/common/cmd/cmd-inet/usr.sbin/in.gated/task.c
	- added use of send() for null address rather than using only
	  sendto().  Gated assumed sendto() with null address is functionally
	  equivalent to send(), this is not true in gemini.
	  EGP connections fail without this fix.


OTHER SOURCE MODIFICICATIONS
----------------------------
usr/src/common/cmd/cmd-inet/usr.sbin/in.gated/krt_symbols.c
	- used to check ipforwarding and ipsendredirects
usr/src/common/cmd/cmd-inet/usr.sbin/in.gated/krt_lladdr_sunos4.c
	- returns MAC address for /dev/net?
	- requires _KMEMUSER definition
usr/src/common/cmd/cmd-inet/usr.sbin/in.gated/sigconv.awk
	- changed "SIGMAX" to "MAXSIG"

usr/src/common/cmd/cmd-inet/usr.sbin/in.gated/rt_static.c
	- v. minor bugfix (fixed in later rel)
usr/src/common/cmd/cmd-inet/usr.sbin/in.gated/ospf_monitor.c
	- v. minor bugfix (fixed in later rel)

usr/src/common/cmd/cmd-inet/usr.sbin/in.gated/rt_radix.c
	- Fixed RT_SANITY code (although we do not set RT_SANITY in
	  defines.h -- it is set in OSR5 gated).


OTHER RELATED SOURCE FILES
--------------------------
usr/src/common/cmd/cmd-nm/usr.sbin/snmp/in.snmpd/snmpd.peers
usr/src/common/cmd/cmd-inet/etc/services
usr/src/common/cmd/cmd-inet/etc/protocols
	- bgp and smux services required by gated
	- ospf protocol required by gated



MISC FIXES
==========
a) SCCS clashes use %""A rather than %A
	bgp_sync.c policy.c rip.c
b) casting (caddr_t)
	*mib.c
c) changed #ifdef SCO_GEMINI into (SCO_GEMINI, SCO_UW21, SCO_OSR5)
	task.c krt.c krt_symbols.c
	krt_rt_sock.c krt_rtread_kinfo.c
	bgp_init.c ospf_rxmon.c snmp_isode.h
d) replaced krt_ifread_ioctl.c and krt_lladdr_sunos4.c with
   krt_ifread_kinfo.c which uses RTSTR_GETIFINFO to read the
   interface list (SIOCGIFCONF failed to provide the last 2 bytes
   of the MAC address).
