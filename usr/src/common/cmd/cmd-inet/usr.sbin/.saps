# This file is essential for pushing packet filters into the kernel. 
# It must exist for packet filtering to operate correctly.
#
# Comments in this file are lines that start with a pound sign (#).
#
# Each entry defines a SAP type for which the pushfilter will attempt to
# load a compiled filter definition into the DLPI driver. A push will
# succeed if the SAP type is currently bound to the network driver.
# An entry may be commented out if a framing type or protocol (such as RARP)
# is not in use. 
#
# The following SAP codes are for Ethernet II (RFC 894) framing:
