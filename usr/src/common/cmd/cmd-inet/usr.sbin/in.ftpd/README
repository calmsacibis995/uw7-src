#ident	"@(#)README	1.14"

The source on which this FTP server is based was obtained from:
ftp://ftp.academ.com/pub/wu-ftpd/private/wu-ftpd-2.4.2-beta-15.tar.Z

This release is maintained by Academ Consulting Services as a public
service to the Internet and is an unofficial enhanced version of the
Washington University FTP server version 2.4.

Only the parts of this distribution which are used are included in
this directory.

Most files are from the src directory.

getusershell.c, strcasestr.c and strsep.c are from the support directory.

config.h was created from src/config/config.uxw with the #include "../config.h"
replaced by a copy of the top level config.h.

A #ident string was added to all files.

The following files were created by SCO:
README
ftpaccess
ftpconversions
ftpgroups
ftphosts
ftpusers
in.ftpd.mk
pipeline.c

Fixes to the following bugs in Beta 15 are included and were mailed to
wu-ftpd-bugs@academ.com:
None

To make it easier to upgrade to newer versions, changes for UnixWare/Gemini
are marked with the UXW define and include:
config.h:
- Don't define SPT_TYPE, it is defined in in.ftpd.mk.
- Added #defines required by setproctitle().
- Added #defines for handling privileges (functionality taken from the
  UnixWare 2.1 ftpd source), done this way rather than changing the source
  files to minimise changes when upgrading to a new version.
- Added bigcrypt #define to support long passwords.
ftpcmd.y:
- SYST reply changed to be consistent with the UnixWare 2.1 ftpd.
ftpd.c:
- setproctitle() functionality added for use by ftpwho.
- Added long password support and a check for inactive logins.
- Performance changes:
  o When sending data, use a minimum buffer size of FTPBUFSIZ.
  o When receiving data, use a buffer size of FTPBUFSIZ.
  o Added sendv support, conditional on SENDV being defined.
getusershell.c:
- okshells list changed to be consistent with the UnixWare 2.1 ftpd source.
