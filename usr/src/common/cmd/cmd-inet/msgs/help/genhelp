INSTALLATION OVERVIEW
The installation program prepares your computer's hardware
and copies the UnixWare software onto your computer's hard
disk(s).  This process includes partitioning hard disk(s),
selecting file systems, and transferring the UnixWare
system files to your hard disk(s).

A system setup has been preselected for you.  Unless you
change the preselected options, UnixWare will be installed
on your computer using default partitions and file systems.

Changing these defaults requires planning and knowledge of
partitions and file systems.  See the Installation
Handbook.
