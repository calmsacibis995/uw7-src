ABSTRACT:Name Mapping Administration
	System administration of name-mapping files includes
	adding, removing, and listing of name mappings as well
	as, administration of mappings within a scheme
	including enabling/disabling of the user-controlled
	mapping mechanism.

scheme_add:Add a Name Mapping File
	This task allows you to add a new name-mapping file.

scheme_list:List All Schemes with Defined Name Mapping Files
	This task lists all schemes for which name-mapping
	files had been defined.

scheme_remove:Remove a Name Mapping File
	This task provides a controlled means to remove a
	name-mapping file.

mappings:Name-Mapping Administration
	System administration of the name-mapping also
	includes enabling/disabling the user-controlled
	name-mapping mechanism.

scheme_name:Scheme Name
	Enter the name of the name mapping scheme.

name_descr:Remote Name Descriptor
	Enter the remote name descriptor.  The remote name
	descriptor should have the form X#DX#D ... X#, where
	X is the letter 'M' (Mandatory), # is a single-digit
	field number, and D is a delimiter character such as
	a '.' or '@'.

local_name:Local Name
	Enter the local logname into which a remote name is
	being mapped.  This name must be a valid login name
	on the local system.

remote_name:Remote Name
	Enter the remote name which is to be mapped into a
	local name.

add:Add a Mapping
	This task provides a controlled means to add a name
	mapping.

list:List Specific Mappings
	This task provides a controlled means to list mapping
	entries in the system-administrated mappings.  This
	task does not list the user-controlled mappings.

remove:Remove One or More Mappings
	This task provides a controlled means to remove a
	name-mapping from the system-administrated mappings.
	This task does not affect the user-controlled
	mappings.

enable:Enable User-Controlled Mapping
	This task causes the name-mapping function to include
	the user-controlled mappings.  It also enables users
	to read or modify mappings.

disable:Disable User-Controlled Mapping
	This task causes the name-mapping function to ignore
	the user-controlled mappings.  It also removes the
	ability for users to read or modify that database.

check:Check for Mapping File Problems
	This task provides a controlled means to check for
	name mapping inconsistencies.  Entries with 
	inconsistencies, nonexistent local lognames, or
	garbled syntax are reported.

fix:Fix Mapping File Problems
	This task provides a controlled means to fix name
	mapping inconsistencies.  Entries with
	inconsistencies, nonexistent local logname, or
	garbled syntax are reported and fixed interactively.
