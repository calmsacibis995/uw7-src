# /usr/X/adm/fmount:  This is an intermediate script to be used by the 
# Media Manager to mount peripheral devices under specific mount points
# reserved by the MediaMgr.  It is not intended to be used from the 
# command line.  The fmount command is accessible to all desktop users by 
# default to allow users to mount peripheral devices through
# the Media Manager only.  If tfadmin fmount is invoked from the command
# line it might fail with some of the mount(1) command options.
# The system owner should provide a separate entry for the mount command 
# in the tfm dtabase for to those users that will be allowed to execute 
# mount(1) from the command line.
