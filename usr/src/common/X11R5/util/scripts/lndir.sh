# Used to create a copy of the a directory tree that has links for all
# non- directories (except those named RCS or SCCS).  If you are
# building the distribution on more than one machine, you should use
# this script.
#
# If your master sources are located in /usr/local/src/X and you would like
# your link tree to be in /usr/local/src/new-X, do the following:
#
# 	%  mkdir /usr/local/src/new-X
#	%  cd /usr/local/src/new-X
# 	%  lndir ../X
