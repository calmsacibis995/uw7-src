 * need to add the appropriate algorithm if you wish to
 * use XDM-AUTHENTICATION-1/XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1.
 *
 * The interface for this routine is quite simple.  All three
 * arguments are arrays of 8 unsigned characters, the first two
 * are 64 bits of useful data, the last is 56 bits of useful
 * data packed into 8 bytes, using the low 7 bits of each
 * byte, filling the high bit with odd parity.

 * Examine the XDMCP specification for the correct algorithm
