The UNIX System includes a variety of files, usually referred to as "system
setup" or "configuration" files, that allow you to tailor the computer to
meet your needs.  When your new UNIX System was installed, new copies of
these files were copied onto your hard disk.  Your old copies of these 
files were saved for you in /etc/inst/save.user.  They will remain there
until you choose to remove them.  They will not be used to run your UNIX
System.
