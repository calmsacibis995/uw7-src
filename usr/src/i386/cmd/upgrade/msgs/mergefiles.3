Help: Combining Files

Copies of your original UNIX System setup files have been saved.  If you
wish, any of the changes you made to these files after they were installed
can be automatically made to the newly installed versions.  If you choose
not to combine the files, your original versions of these files will be left
in /etc/inst/save.user.  You may need to combine these files yourself before
all of your applications will work properly.  The UNIX System will use only
the new versions of the files when installation is complete.

For detailed instructions, press the 'F1' (or '?') key at any time.

The UNIX System includes a variety of files usually referred to as
"system setup" or "configuration" files, that allow you to tailor the
computer to meet your needs.  When your new UNIX System was installed,
new versions of these files were copied on to your hard disk.  You now
have the option to have the installation process automatically add your
changes into the new versions of these files.  If this effort is 
successful, the computer will be set up to match the way it was before you 
installed the new system.  All of your applications should work correctly
when you reboot your machine.

Should you choose to not automatically combine the files or should the
installation process not be able to combine all the files, you may need to
do some additional work yourself to get one or more of your applications
working.  You should refer to the installation guide for more information.
