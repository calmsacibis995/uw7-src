#	This is the default, standard profile provided to users.
#	Users are expected to edit it to meet their own needs.
#
#	If you have a profile that is attempting to read from the
#	terminal or is using the stty(1) command to set terminal 
#	settings, you may find that GRAPHICAL LOGIN does not give
#	you a desktop metaphor session.
#
#	To update your profile, you should surround any section
#	that reads from the terminal or performs stty(1) commands
#	with the following 'if' statement:
#
#	if [ "$XDM_LOGIN" != "yes" ]
#	then
#		:
#		read from the terminal or stty(1) commands
#	fi

if [ "$XDM_LOGIN" != "yes" ]
then
	if [ "`tty`" != "/dev/console" -o x${TERM} = "xansi" ]
	then
		echo "TERM=\c"
		read TERM
	fi

# PATH is set during the login sequence. To enhance your PATH
