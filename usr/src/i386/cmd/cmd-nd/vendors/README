this directory exists to compile user code associated with any given
device driver.  It will generally contain programs used to download
code to the driver.  This prevents the kernel build from compiling 
programs destined for user space.

Programs should install themselves into the $(ROOT)/$(MACH) link kit
but should not worry about packaging issues; these are taken care
of by the driver's nd_mdi file, run by usr/src/work/uts/io/nd/mdi/mdi.mk.
each driver's nd_mdi script does the packaging of the files built in 
these directories.
