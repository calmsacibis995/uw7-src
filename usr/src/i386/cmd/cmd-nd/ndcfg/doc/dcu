                           DCU considerations

                         Document Version: 6.1

There are some considerations necessary when we change the location of
the bcfg files on the system.  Currently, the niccfg program copies
the bcfg files from their original location
/etc/inst/nics/drivers/xxx/xxx.bcfg
into /etc/inst/locale/$LOCALE/menus/nics/config/.  This is where they are
stored and modified.

The dcu program reads the Drvmap file to determine where to find the
bcfg file in /etc/inst/locale/$LOCALE/ according to an undocumented
field in the Drvmap file.  For example, the first file would lead to
/etc/inst/locale/$LOCALE/menus/nics/config/en596e.

#ident  "@(#)Drvmap     2.1"
#ident  "$Header$"
en596|Y|N|Network Interface Cards|
|EISA||Unisys Embedded 596|menus/nics/config/en596e
|EISA|UNB0048|Unisys 596 EISA Card|menus/nics/config/en596
|EISA|COG9004|Cogent EM932 EISA Card|menus/nics/config/co596

This is used by dcu to set the bcfgfile variable in /etc/dcu.d/menus/boards
to on of the following (in order of preference):

1) /etc/inst/locale/$LOCALE/<Drvmap path>      (all $LOCALEs)
but if #1 doesn't exist, then use:
2) /etc/inst/locale/C/<Drvmap path>            (only for *NON*-C $LOCALE)
or
2) /etc/conf/bcfg.d/$y/$y.bcfg                 (everything else)

dcu then sources in the bcfgfile and checks to see if the CUSTOM_NUM
variable is zero.  If not then dcu prompts the user for the choices
in each of the CUSTOM[x] variables.   dcu also knows about the CUSTOM[x]
help files.

OPEN ISSUES:

1)If we change the location of these files we will need to change dcu too.
2)What should this pathname be in the Drvmap file?
