                          Future Extensions

                         Document Version: 6.1

The following concepts were agreed on to extend the MDI specification.
They will take the form of a general routine that MDI drivers call at
their init/load time to inform DLPI of their requirements.  

OPEN ISSUE:  How much of the information from the #ADAPTER section will
be in the resmgr at DLM load time for ISA boards? 
(obviously rebooting so xxinit/xxstart routines can access info in resmgr
isn't acceptable)

Call a service request/"registration" routine for the following
  services (along with any applicable arguments for the routine).  This
cleans up the netX/space.c files 

  -Source routing (include following from netX/space.c:
    TX_RESP, RX_ARE, RX_STE_BCS, RX_STE_UCS, MAX_TX, MIN_TX, TX_RECUR,
        ARE_DISABLE

  -Multicasting (along with table size the firmware supports)

  -changing default Tx monitor time.

Many of the others can be made into CUSTOM[x] variables

The SEND_SPEED and RECEIVE_SPEED variables will be written to the info
files in a different format.  This affects the TCP/IP group in Watford,
since the tcp init script will need to be changed for new
ifconfig perf values.
