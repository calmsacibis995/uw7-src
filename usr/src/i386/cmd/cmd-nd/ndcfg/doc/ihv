                         IHV Diskette format

                         Document Version: 6.1

diskette formatted as either DOS or UnixWare s5 filesystem.
If formatted as s5, certain character must be capitalized for idinstall.

Note that this differs slightly from the UnixWare 2.1 and 2.1.1 IHV diskette
format.

Your driver may use more DSP files than the following files in the example
below (i.e. Rc, Sd, Autotune, etc.)

The example below assumes that netdrvr is the name of your driver.  This
should correspond to the DRIVER_NAME= in the bcfg file.

Note that help files should adhere to DOS file naming conventions

An alternate method is to require IHV disks to be in UnixWare pkgadd format
and the files would be installed/copied into the appropriate location.
We would need to document this location and process in more depth.  As the
Gemini installation technology isn't well defined, I propose method#1 above.
It also allows vendors to include drivers for 3 (possibly more) operating
systems on one DOS formatted floppy:

Windows
OpenServer 5.0 MDI  - custom installable image; see appendix A.
Gemini         MDI  - per the above

This is a powerful incentive to choose the first method.
