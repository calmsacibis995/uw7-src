ABOUT THIS OPTION
Type in the system node name and then press <Enter>.

ABOUT THE SYSTEM NODE NAME
The system node name is the name of your computer.

If your computer will not be part of a network, you can name
it anything you like but you should keep the name short.

If your computer is part of a network and already has a name,
you should re-use the existing name.

If your computer will be part of a network but does not have
a name, contact your network or system administrator to help
you select a name that is unique on the network.
