ABOUT Emergency Recovery Feature
You have booted the system using the emergency 
recovery floppy created for this system. This
helps you to check and repair your hard disk 
or restore it using the emergency recovery tape.

You can invoke a shell by selecting the 'Access
UnixWare Shell' menu item, where you have access to 
a few tools like fsck, vi, fdisk, prtvtoc etc. From 
this shell, you can check and repair the hard disk.

If the hard disk is sane, you can mount the file
systems on the hard disk under /mnt, by selecting 
'Mount File Systems' menu item.

You can unmount all the mounted file systems under
/mnt, using 'Unmount File Systems' menu item.

The 'Mount File Systems' and 'Unmount File Systems' 
options are displayed only if the hard disk is sane.

You can restore the hard disk(s) using the emergency
recovery tape by selecting the 'Restore Disk(s)' menu 
item.

After repairing the hard disk or restoring it using
the emergency recovery tape, you can reboot the system
by selecting 'Reboot' menu item.
