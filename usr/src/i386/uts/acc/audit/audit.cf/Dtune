%% Security Parameters
%C Security Parameters
These tunable parameters are associated with Audit and SUM Privilege.
%%% Audit Parameters
% ADT_BSIZE
This parameter controls the size, in bytes, of an audit buffer.
A large audit buffer may improve system performance by allowing you to
store more data in main memory and to reduce the number of disk writes.
However, an overly large audit buffer may use space required for other
data structures and thus reduce performance.
% ADT_LWP_BSIZE
This parameter controls the size of the buffer allocated for each 
lightweight process (LWP).
Events generated by a particular LWP
are placed in its own buffer, and this buffer is dumped into
an audit buffer when it is full.
% ADT_NBUF
This parameter controls the number of audit buffers
available on the system.
Upon initial installation, the system uses a value of
two for this parameter.
% ADT_NLVLS
This parameter controls the number of individual security levels
that can be set for object level auditing.
It is useful only when the Mandatory Access Control (MAC) feature
is installed.
Upon initial installation, the system uses a value of
four for this parameter.
If you want to audit more than four levels, you must
change the value of this parameter.
