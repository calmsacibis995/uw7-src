%% File System Parameters
%%% XENIX File System Parameters
% XXFSFLUSH
Specifies how often the fsflush daemon
writes XENIX file system inode data out to disk
on XENIX file systems.
A smaller value causes the daemon to write more often,
making the file system ``harder,'' that is,
less likely to lose data in a crash.
However, it does take some
CPU
time.
