%% File System Parameters
%%% DOSFS File System Parameters
% DOSFSFLUSH
Specifies how often to run the fsflush daemon
to write data out to disk on DOSFS file systems.
A smaller value causes the daemon to run more often,
making the file system ``harder,'' that is,
less likely to lose data in a crash.
However, it does take some CPU time.
% DOSFSNINODE
Specifies 
the maximum number of inode entries in the DOSFS inode table
when a DOSFS file is configured in your system.
