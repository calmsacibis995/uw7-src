%% Timer and Scheduler Parameters
% FCMAXUPRI
Defines the range
for the fixed class scheduler priorities.
This is equivalent to
TSMAXUPRI,
which is used for time sharing class.
% FC_AFFINITY_ON
The  setting indicates 
whether a lightweight process (LWP) of this scheduler class
should be scheduled on the same processor that it ran on last,
when the cache is still warm.
A setting of 1 indicates that the LWP should be run on
the same processor when the cache is still warm.
See the
Processor Cache Affinity Parameters descriptions
for how it is determined whether the cache is warm.
