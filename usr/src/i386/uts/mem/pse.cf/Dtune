%% Virtual Memory (VM) Parameters

% SEGKMEM_PSE_BYTES
Specifies the amount of physical memory to reserve for
use by the kernel memory allocator (KMA).
Setting aside memory for this purpose can provide a performance benefit
for systems that heavily use KMA.
The physical memory is reserved for use by KMA and
cannot be used for anything else.

SEGKMEM_BYTES is the minimum size of the kpgseg kernel 
virtual segment.  This segment is used by the kernel memory allocator
for all its memory, by the hardware address translation layer (HAT)
for its page tables, and by various drivers for both temporary and
permanent mappings.  

SEGKMEM_PSE_BYTES will be rounded up to the next 4MB boundary.
SEGKMEM_PSE_BYTES should be less than SEGKMEM_BYTES, since some KMA requests
(for DMA-accessible buffers, or buffers with special alignment
or boundary restrictions) can only be satisfied with non-PSE backed KMA.
The system will automatically reduce SEGKMEM_PSE_BYTES 
so that at least 2 Megabytes of non-PSE backed KMA is available.
