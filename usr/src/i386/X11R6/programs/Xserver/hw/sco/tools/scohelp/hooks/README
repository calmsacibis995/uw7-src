This directory contains hook files for all video adapters
that require 'Special Help' to install using the Video 
Configuration Manager.

vidconfGUI.hk - This file is the master 'hook file' used to obtain 
	help under the Video Configuration Manager.  The basename must match 
	SCO_VIDCONF_GUI_MSG_HELPBOOK in vidconf/vidconfGUI/vidconfGUI.msg_en.
	In SCO OpenServer this was VidConfigG.  In Gemini this was vidconfGUI.

*.hk	- video adapter hooklet files.  These files are installed in 
	/usr/lib/grafinfo/dochook.  When the Video Configuration Manager
	starts up, it concatentates each hooklet into vidconfGUI.hk.

	A hooklet file is only needed if there are Special help requirements
	to get this particular video adapter installed that the user should
	be made aware of during configuration.

	If a driver is removed, the hooklet file should also be removed
	from the system.
