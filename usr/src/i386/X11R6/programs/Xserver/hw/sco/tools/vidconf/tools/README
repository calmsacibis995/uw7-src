O.K.  This is a little more sane now.   You can create the stanza file by 
simply typing "make stanza" in this directory.   It will create a 
video.stz file and then use the file stanza.fixes to patch up any special 
changes.  

If you need to make more hand edits to the stanza file, use the following
steps:

	make stanza
	edit video.stz
	cp video.stz save.stz
	get -e stanza.fixes
	rm stanza.fixes
	make stanza
	diff -c video.stz save.stz > stanza.fixes
	

This will automagically create a new stanza.fixes file that does the 
right thing.  Once you are done, sadmin the new stanza file into the source
tree as NNNx.video.stz.

The idea is that all the hand made change are in the previous version of the
file.  Since the stanza file usually just has new things added to it, 
patch can handle making the same changes over and over again.  
These patches currently include the following:

	Change 340x0 and Microfield cards to configure later
	IBM XGA and XGA2 entries
	The other vga entrie
	Separate entries for Compaq Qvision ISA and EISA cards
