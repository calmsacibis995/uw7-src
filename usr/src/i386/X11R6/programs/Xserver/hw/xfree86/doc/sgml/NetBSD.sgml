<sect>What and Where is XFree86?

<p>
XFree86 is a port of X11R6 that supports several versions of
Intel-based Unix.  It is derived from X386 1.2, which was the X server
distributed with X11R5.  This release consists of many new features
and performance improvements as well as many bug fixes.  The release
is available as source patches against the X Consortium X11R6 code, as
well as binary distributions for many architectures.

See the <url url="COPYRIGHT.html" name="Copyright Notice">.

The sources for XFree86 are available by anonymous ftp from:

<url name="ftp.XFree86.org:/pub/XFree86/current"
url="ftp://ftp.XFree86.org/pub/XFree86/current">

Binaries for NetBSD 1.1 and NetBSD-current are available from:

<url name="ftp.XFree86.org:/pub/XFree86/current/binaries/NetBSD"
url="ftp://ftp.XFree86.org/pub/XFree86/current/binaries/NetBSD">

Other versions:

Binaries built with NetBSD 1.1 are not compatible with earlier
versions. 

If you're still running NetBSD 0.9 or 1.0, you should think about
upgrading to a newer version of NetBSD first.

If you don't, you'll have to build XFree86 from the sources.  XFree86
3.1.2 compiles cleanly under NetBSD 1.0; it has not been tested with
NetBSD 0.9. Binaries built on 1.0 will work on 1.1.

XFree86 3.1.2 also builds on NetBSD/sparc. See section <ref id="sparc"
name="Building on NetBSD/sparc"> for details.

<sect>Bug Reports for This Document

<p>
Send email to <em/matthieu@laas.fr/ (Matthieu Herrb) or
<em/XFree86@XFree86.org/ if you have comments or suggestions about
this file and we'll revise it.

<sect>Installing the Binaries

<p>
The binary distribution is composed of a number of  tar archives
which are the executables, servers, fonts, libraries, include files,
man pages, config files, and the server link kit.  The full distribution
takes over 55MB of disk space.  

All archives are now made using the NetBSD package tools. We recommend
that you install these tools first.  All packages can be installed
using <tt/pkg_add/.

Note that many clients were moved from the X11R6 distribution to the
``contrib'' area. However, they are still distributed with the
XFree86 binary distribution. 

    The contents of the packages are:

<descrip>
<tag/REQUIRED:/
    <descrip>
    <tag/X312doc/ READMEs and XFree86 specific man pages.
    <tag/X312bin/ all of the executable X client applications and shared libs
    <tag/X312font/ the misc and 75dpi fonts
    <tag/X312lib/ data files needed at runtime
    <tag/X312cfg/ customizable xinit, xdm, and fs runtime configuration files.
    </descrip>

    Choose at least one of the following to match your hardware:

    <descrip>
    <tag/X312svga/  the 8-bit pseudo-color X server for Super VGA cards
    <tag/X312vg16/ the 4-bit pseudo-color X server for VGA &amp; SVGA cards.
    <tag/X312mono/  the Monochrome X Server
    <tag/X3128514/  the X server for IBM 8514/A and compatible boards
    <tag/X312agx/   the X server for AGX boards
    <tag/X312mc8/ the X server for ATI Mach8 graphics boards
    <tag/X312mc32/ the X server for ATI Mach32 graphics boards
    <tag/X312mc64/ the X server for ATI Mach64 graphics boards
    <tag/X312p9k/	the X server for P9000 based boards
    <tag/X312s3/ 	the X server for S3 based boards
    <tag/X312w32/	the X server for et4000w32 based boards
    </descrip>

<tag/OPTIONAL:/

    <descrip>
    <tag/X312fs/ the font server with man pages.
    <tag/X312prog/ the X11 header files and static libraries needed only 
		  for compiling other X applications
    <tag/X312man/ man pages except XFree86 specific ones in the doc archive
    <tag/X312xfnt/ the other fonts (100dpi, scaled, Japanese, Chinese, etc)
    <tag/X312link/ X server reconfiguration kit
    </descrip>
</descrip>

If this is your first time, then you can safely install all of the
packages.  As a minimal install, you'll need doc, bin, fonts lib,
config, and one X server.

<sect1> Installing the packages with <tt/pkg_add/

<p>
<enum>
<item> Become ``root''.

<item> For each package that you want to install type:
<tscreen><verb>
 # pkg_add <pkg>.tgz
</verb></tscreen>
If you don't have enough room in /usr/X11R6 you can specify another
directory by using the <tt/-p/ option to <tt/pkg_add/. See
<em/pkg_add(8)/ for details. Then make a symbolic link
<tt>/usr/X11R6</tt> to this directory.

</enum>

Continue with item <ref id="install-cont" name="Additional Setup">
below. 
  
<sect1>Installing the packages without <tt/pkg_add/
<p>
    To unpack and install the archives:
<enum>
<item> Create some destination directory in which you'd like the
       X distribution to live.  <tt>/usr/X11R6</tt> is recommended, but if that
       partition is full (as it is on my machine), then just create an
       alternate directory, and sym-link <tt>/usr/X11R6</tt> to this place.

    ie, on my machine, I do the following:
<tscreen><verb>
    % cd /usr/local
    % mkdir X11R6
    % ln -s /usr/local/X11R6 /usr/X11R6
</verb></tscreen>

<item> You must be logged in as root to unpack the archives and use a
	``umask'' value of 022.  Typing ``<tt/umask 022/'' sets it.
	<em/Caution:/ If you do not extract the files as user ``root''
	with the correct umask you may not be able to run XFree86.
	The X server needs special permissions that are only granted
	to the root user.

	Assuming that the destination directory for XFree86 3.1.2 is
	<tt>/usr/X11R6</tt>, run the following from wherever all the archive
	files are (replace <tt>/usr/X11R6</tt> with wherever you wish them to
	go if that isn't the place):
<tscreen><verb>
 cd /usr/X11R6

 tar xzf X312doc.tgz
 tar xzf X312bin.tgz
 tar xzf X312lib.tgz 
 tar xzf X312font.tgz
 tar xzf X312man.tgz

 tar xzf X312link.tgz
 tar xzf X312prog.tgz
 tar xzf X312xfnt.tgz
 tar xzf X312fs.tgz
 tar xzf X312cfg.tgz

</verb></tscreen>
	And unpack the server(s) you need:
<tscreen><verb>
 tar xzf X312<server>.tgz
</verb></tscreen>
</enum>

<sect1>Additional setup <label id="install-cont">
<p>
<enum>
<item>Set the <tt/XWINHOME/ environment
variable to the path where you installed XFree86. Under csh  type:
<tscreen><verb>
 setenv XWINHOME /usr/X11R6
</verb></tscreen>

       under sh  type
<tscreen><verb>
 XWINHOME=/usr/X11R6 
 export XWINHOME
</verb></tscreen>

	(Replace <tt>/usr/X11R6</tt> by the appropriate dir if necessary).

       Also, don't forget to include these lines in your <tt/.login/
       or <tt/.profile/ for permanent use.

<item> Create a symbolic link in <tt>&dollar;{XWINHOME}/bin</tt> named
       ``<tt/X/'' that points to the server that matches your video
	card: See the <em/XF86_*/ man pages for hardware details. For
	example, if you have an ET4000 based SVGA card:

<tscreen><verb>
 cd $XWINHOME/bin
 rm -f X
 ln -s XF86_SVGA X
</verb></tscreen>

<item> Install support for the shared libraries: add the following lines at 
        the end of <tt>/etc/rc.local</tt>:

<tscreen><verb>
 if [ -d /usr/X11R6/lib ]; then
    echo 'Adding X shared libraries'
    ldconfig /usr/X11R6/lib
 fi
</verb></tscreen>

<item> Reboot your machine to take all previous modifications into
	account.
</enum>

If X was already installed on your machine and you have customized
your xinit or xdm runtime configuration scripts, omit the config
archive or unpack it elsewhere and extract only that which you need.

<quote>
    <bf/NOTE:/ you don't need to uncompress the fonts files in
    <tt>lib/X11/fonts</tt>. If you want to uncompress them anyway,
    don't forget to run ``<tt/mkfontdir/'' in each directory after
    that.
</quote>

<sect> Installing Xdm, the display manager

<p>
Since xdm is dynamically linked against -lcrypt, there's no issue on
export restriction outside US for this binary distribution of xdm: it
does not contain the DES encryption code. So it's now included in the
bin package.

To start the display manager, log in as root on the console and type:
``<tt/xdm -nodaemon/''.

You can start xdm automatically on bootup by disabling the console getty
adding the following code to <tt>/etc/rc.local</tt>:

<tscreen><verb>
  if [ -x /usr/X11R6/bin/xdm ]; then
    echo -n ' xdm'; /usr/X11R6/bin/xdm
  fi
</verb></tscreen>

To disable the console getty, change ``<bf/on/'' to ``<bf/off/'' in
the console entry in <tt>/etc/ttys</tt>:

<tscreen><verb>
 ttyv0	"/usr/libexec/getty Pc"	pc	off secure
</verb></tscreen>


<sect> Configuring X for Your Hardware

<p>
The <tt/XF86Config/ file tells the X server what kind of monitor,
video card and mouse you have.  You <em/must/ create it to tell the
server what specific hardware you have.

You'll need info on your hardware:
<itemize>
<item> Your mouse type, baud rate and it's /dev entry.
<item> The video card's chipset (e.g. ET4000, S3, etc).
<item> Your monitor's sync frequencies.
</itemize>

XFree86 3.1 and later releases uses a new configuration file format.

The recommended way to generate an <tt/XF86Config/ file is to use the
<tt/xf86config/ utility.  Also, there is a sample file installed as
<tt>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XF86Config.eg</tt>, which can be used as a
starting point.

For details about the <tt/XF86Config/ file format, refer to the
<em>XF86Config(4/5)</em> manual page.

In order to protect your hardware from damage, the server will no
longer read <tt>XF86Config</tt> files from a user's home directory,
but requires that it be in <tt>/etc/XF86Config</tt>,
<tt>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XF86Config.hostname</tt> or
<tt>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XF86Config</tt>.

Once you've set up a XF86Config file, you can fine tune the video
modes with the <tt>xvidtune</tt> utility. 

If you have a <tt>Xconfig</tt> file for XFree86 2.x, use reconfig to
translate part of
it into the new format:
<verb>
   # reconfig <Xconfig >XF86Config
</verb>
and complete the rest according to the <tt>XF86Config</tt> man page and the
<tt>XF86Config.sample</tt> file as a template.


If your mouse does not work try using <tt>kermit</tt> or <tt>tip</tt>
to connect to the mouse serial port and verify that it does indeed
generate characters.

<sect1> Configuring a PS/2 mouse for XFree86 on NetBSD

<p>
The NetBSD pms mouse driver handles PS/2 style mice as
Busmouse. Specify the protocol `busmouse' in the mouse section of your
<tt/XF86Config/ file if you're using a PS/2 mouse.

<sect> Running X

<p>
8mb of memory is a recommended minimum for running X.  The server,
window manager and an xterm take about 4 Mb of memory themselves.  On
a 4Mb system that would leave nothing left over for other applications
like gcc that expect a few meg free.  X will work with 4Mb of memory,
but in practice compilation while running X can take 5 or 10 times as
long due to constant paging.

The easiest way for new users to start X windows is to type: ``<tt/startx
>&amp; startx.log/''.  Error messages are lost unless you redirect them
because the server takes over the screen.

To get out of X windows, type: ``<tt/exit/'' in the console xterm.
You can customize your X by creating <tt/.xinitrc/, <tt/.xserverrc/,
and <tt/.twmrc/ files in your home directory as described in the xinit
and startx man pages.

<sect> Kernel Support for X

<p>
To make sure X support is enabled under NetBSD, the following
line must be in your config file in <tt>/sys/arch/i386/conf</tt>:

<tscreen>
 options XSERVER, UCONSOLE
</tscreen>

The server supports the two standard NetBSD/i386 console drivers:
pccons and pcvt. They are detected at runtime and no configuration of
the server itself is required.

The pccons driver is the most widely tested and is the console driver
contained in the NetBSD binary distribution's kernels.

The pcvt console driver is bundled with NetBSD. The pcvt X
mode is compatible with the pccons driver X mode. It offers several
virtual consoles and international keyboard support. In order to use
this driver, change the line:

<tscreen>
 device          pc0     at isa? port "IO_KBD" irq 1
</tscreen>

to

<tscreen>
 device         vt0     at isa? port "IO_KBD" irq 1
</tscreen>

in your kernel config file, and rebuild and install your kernel.

Syscons and codrv are not bundled with NetBSD 1.1. They are
available by anonymous FTP from a number of sites. They are not
supported by the XFree86 binary distribution anymore. You can compile
support for them by adding -DSYSCONS_SUPPORT or -DCODRV_SUPPORT to
<tt/XFree86ConsoleDefines/ in <tt/xf86site.def/. See the section <ref
id="console-drivers" name="Console drivers"> for details.


If using pccons you get the message:
<tscreen><verb>
> Fatal server error:
> xf86OpenConsole: CONSOLE_X_MODE_OFF failed (Inappropriate ioctl for device)
> Was expecting pccons driver with X support
> Check your kernel's console driver configuration and /dev entries
> 
</verb></tscreen>

then delete <tt>/dev/ttyv0</tt>. I don't know why ``<tt/MAKEDEV/''
move <tt>/dev/ttyqf</tt> to <tt>/dev/ttyv0</tt>. (from Hung-Chi Chu
<em/hcchu@r350.ee.ntu.edu.tw/)


<sect1>Aperture Driver
<p>
By default NetBSD 0.9C and higher include the BSD 4.4 kernel security
feature that disable access to the <tt>/dev/mem</tt> device when in
multi-users mode. But XFree86 servers can take advantage (or require)
linear access to the display memory.

The P9000, Mach64 and AGX servers require linear memory access, other
accelerated servers can take advantage of it, but do not require it.

There are two ways to allow XFree86 to access linear memory:
<enum>
<item> Disable the kernel security feature by adding
   `option INSECURE' in the kernel configuration file and build a new
   kernel. 

   On NetBSD-1.0 you have to disable kernel security by initializing
   the ``<bf/securelevel/'' variable to <bf/-1/ in
   <tt>/sys/kern/kern_sysctl.c</tt>, line 205. For more informations,
   see the comments in <tt>/usr/include/sys/systm.h</tt>.

<item> Install the NetBSD aperture driver:
   <enum>	
   <item> add the following lines to the end of <tt>/etc/rc.local</tt>:
<tscreen><verb>
 KERNDIR=/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/kernel
 if [ -f ${KERNDIR}/ap.o ]; then
   modload -o ${KERNDIR}/ap -e ap -p ${KERNDIR}/apinstall ${KERNDIR}/ap.o
 fi
</verb></tscreen>
    The distributed ap.o won't work with NetBSD 1.0. In this case,
    unpack <tt>xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/etc/apNetBSD.shar</tt>
    and recompile it.
	
    <item> Reboot your system. XFree86 will auto-detect the aperture
       driver if available.
    </enum>

    <bf/Warning:/ if you boot another kernel than <tt>/netbsd</tt>,
    loadable kernel modules can crash your system. Always boot in
    single user mode when you want to run another kernel.

<quote>
   <bf/Caveat:/ the NetBSD aperture driver only allows one access at a time
   (so that the system is in the same security state once X is
   launched). This means that if you run multiple servers on multiples
   VT, only the first one will have linear memory access.
   Use 'option INSECURE' if you need more that one X server at a time.
</quote>

</enum>


<sect1>MIT-SHM
<p>
NetBSD 1.0 and later supports System V shared memory. If XFree86 
detects this support in your kernel, it will support the MIT-SHM
extension.

    To add support for system V shared memory to your kernel add the
    lines:

<tscreen><verb>
 # System V-like IPC
 options         SYSVMSG
 options         SYSVSEM
 options         SYSVSHM
</verb></tscreen>
 
    to your kernel config file. Then from <tt>/sys/arch/i386/config</tt>, type:

<tscreen><verb>
 # rm -f ../compile/<KERNEL-NAME>/*
 # config <KERNEL-NAME>
 # cd ../compile/<KERNEL-NAME>
 # make depend 
 # make
</verb></tscreen>

 Then install your new kernel and re-boot:

<tscreen><verb>
 # cp /netbsd /onetbsd
 # cp netbsd /
 # reboot
</verb></tscreen>


<sect> Rebuilding the XFree86 Distribution

<p>
The server link kit allow you to rebuild just the X server with a
minimum amount of disk space.  Just unpack it, make the appropriate
changes to the <tt/xf86site.def/, type ``<tt>./mkmf</tt>'' and
``<tt/make/'' to link the server.  See <tt>/usr/X11R6/lib/Server/README</tt>
for more info.

See <url url="INSTALL.html" name="INSTALL"> for instructions on unbundling and
building the source distribution.

You should configure the distribution by editing
<tt>xc/config/cf/xf86site.def</tt>  before compiling.  To compile the
sources, invoke ``<tt/make World/'' in the xc directory.

<sect1>Console drivers<label id="console-drivers">

<p>
XFree86 3.1.2 has a configuration option to select the console
drivers to use in <tt/xf86site.def/:
<itemize>
<item> if you're using pccons put:
<tscreen><verb>
 #define XFree86ConsoleDefines -DPCCONS_SUPPORT
</verb></tscreen>
<item> if you're using pcvt put:
<tscreen><verb>
 #define XFree86ConsoleDefines -DPCVT_SUPPORT
</verb></tscreen>
<item> if you're using syscons put:
<tscreen><verb>
 #define XFree86ConsoleDefines -DSYSCONS_SUPPORT
</verb></tscreen>
<item> if you're running codrv put:
<tscreen><verb>
 #define XFree86ConsoleDefines -DCODRV_SUPPORT
</verb></tscreen>
</itemize>
If you don't define <bf/XFree86ConsoleDefines/ in <tt/xf86site.def/ the
pccons and pcvt drivers will be supported.

<sect1>console.h and ioctl_pc.h files:

<p>
If you want to build a server supporting codrv and you
don't already have the corresponding header file 
<tt/ioctl_pc.h/ installed in <tt>/usr/include/machine</tt>, then
install the copy that is supplied in
<tt>xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/etc</tt>.  If you run
NetBSD-current you probably want to install it in
<tt>/usr/src/sys/arch/i386/include</tt> too, so that it get
reinstalled each time you make install in <tt>/usr/src/include</tt>.

If you have installed the  codrv console driver, this
file should be taken from your installed version of the driver.

The <tt/console.h/ file for syscons isn't distributed with XFree86
anymore. You should get it from the syscons distribution.

<sect1> Support for shared libs under NetBSD 1.0 and later

<p>
    By default XFree86 3.1.2 builds for NetBSD with shared libraries 
    support. If you're building on 0.9 or don't want shared libraries 
    add the following line to <tt/xf86site.def/:

<tscreen>	
 #define BuildBsdSharedLibs 	NO
</tscreen>

<sect1>Building on NetBSD/sparc<label id="sparc">

<p>
XFree86 3.1.2 also compiles on NetBSD/sparc. The Sun server
patches from Dennis Ferguson and Matthew Green have been integrated in
<tt>xc/programs/Xserver/hw/sun</tt>.  Small
modifications to <tt/xf86site.def/ are needed:
<itemize>
<item> Set all variables defining the servers to build to
<bf/NO/. (The variables controlling the Sun servers to build
<bf/Xsun24Server/, <bf/XsunServer/ and <bf/XsunMonoServer/ are
defined at the end of <tt/NetBSD.cf/.)
<item> Set <bf/ServerToInstall/ to the sun server of your
choice. (Xsun or XsunMono).
<item> Look at other applicable options in the <url name="INSTALL document"
url="INSTALL.html">.
</itemize>

Problems with this port should be reported to the
<em/port-sparc@NetBSD.Org/ mailing list or directly to me
<em/matthieu@laas.fr/ rather than to the xfree86 mailing list. 

<sect>Building New X Clients

<p>
The easiest way to build a new client (X application) is to use
<tt/xmkmf/ if an <tt/Imakefile/ is included in the sources.  Type
``<tt/xmkmf -a/'' to create the Makefiles, check the configuration if
necessary and type ``<tt/make/''.  Whenever you install additional man
pages you should update <tt/whatis.db/ by running ``<tt>makewhatis
/usr/X11R6/man</tt>''.

To avoid the ``Virtual memory exhausted'' message from cc while
compiling, increase the data and stack size limits (in csh type ``<tt/limit
datasize 32M/'' and ``<tt/limit stacksize 16M/'').

Note: Starting with XFree86 2.1 and NetBSD 0.9A, the symbol
<bf/__386BSD__/ no longer gets defined either by the compiler or via the
X config files for *BSD systems.  When porting clients to *BSD
systems, make use of the symbol <bf/BSD/ for code which is truly
BSD-specific.  The value of the symbol can be used to distinguish
different BSD releases.  For example, code specific to the Net-2 and
later releases can use:

<tscreen>                   
#if (BSD >= 199103)
</tscreen>

To ensure that this symbol is correctly defined, include
<tt>&lt;sys/param.h&gt;</tt> in the source that requires it.  Note that
the symbol <bf/CSRG_BASED/ is defined for *BSD systems in XFree86 3.1.1
and later.  This should be used to protect the inclusion of
<tt>&lt;sys/param.h&gt;</tt>.

For code that really is specific to a particular i386 BSD port, use
<bf/__FreeBSD__/ for FreeBSD, <bf/__NetBSD__/ for NetBSD,
<bf/__386BSD__/ for 386BSD, and <bf/__bsdi__/ for BSD/386.

Another note: If you get the message:

<tscreen>                   
 ld.so: undefined symbol _XtCvtStringToFont 
</tscreen>

at run-time, you've stumbled on a semantic weakness of the NetBSD 
dynamic linker. Applications that use libXmu also need libXt. If the
client uses a standard <tt/Imakefile/, this dependency will probably by
included in the Makefile automagically -- you'll not see the
problem. Otherwise, just add ``<tt/-lXt/'' to your library list in the
Imakefile or Makefile and relink.
