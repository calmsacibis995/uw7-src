/*
 * These are here the very lowlevel VGA bankswitching routines.
 * The segment to switch to is passed via %eax. Only %eax and %edx my be used
 * without saving the original contents.
 *
 * WHY ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE ???
 *
 * These routines must be callable by other assembly routines. But I don't
 * want to have the overhead of pushing and poping the normal stack-frame.

/*
 * what happens really here ?
 *
 * PRA and PRB are segmentpointers to out two segments. They have a granularity
 * of 4096. That means we have to multiply the segmentnumber by 8, if we are
 * working with 32k segments. But since PRA and PRB are 'indexed' registers,
 * the index must be emitted first. This is accomplished by loading %al with
 * the index and %ah with the value. Therefor we must shift the logical
 * segmentnumber by 11.
 *
 * Another quirk is PRA. It's physical VGA mapping starts at 0xA0000, but it is
 * only visible starting form 0xA8000 to 0xAFFFF. That means PRA has to be
 * loaded with a value that points to the previous logical segment.
 *
 * The latter FEATURE was mentioned correctly (but somewhat not understandable)
 * in the registerdoc of the PVGA1A. But it was COMPLETELY WRONG shown in their
 * programming examples....
