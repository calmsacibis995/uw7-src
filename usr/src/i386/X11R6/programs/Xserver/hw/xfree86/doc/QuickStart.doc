  Quick-Start Guide to XFree86 Setup
  Joe Moss

  13 November 1995

  Current releases of XFree86 include several tools that can help to
  automate the process of server configuration. Much of the existing
  documentation, however, describes how to do the job manually, includ-
  ing many technical details.  For those users with esoteric hardware or
  with the desire to get their hands dirty under the hood, this is
  great, but many users are using common hardware and just want to get X
  up and running quickly.  This guide is for them.


  1.  Before You Start

  There are a few bits of information that you will need to have before
  you can setup the server:

      The model name of your video card
        Make sure you know the exact model name of the card.  It may
        help to also know the graphics chipset, RAMDAC, and clock chip
        used on your card.

      The amount of memory on your video card
        Find out how many megabytes of RAM are on your video card.

      Your monitor's specifications
        Specifically, you need to know the horizontal sync rate(s), and
        vertical refresh rate(s).  These are important!  Consult your
        monitor's manual.

      The protocol your mouse uses
        Different mice use different methods to communicate their
        movements to the computer.  Some mice may use more than one (for
        example, they may have a switch on them to select between two
        options).  If you can't find this out, you can try assuming it
        uses a common protocol, such as that used by Microsoft mice.

  2.  What to Do - An Overview

  Okay, now that you have the necessary information (you do have it
  don't you? the previous section is a necessary step), you basically
  have three steps you need to do:

     o  Run xf86config and answer the questions

     o  Fix up the generated XF86Config

  Why did I list only two steps, after I said there were three?  Well,
  that's because after doing the first two (and step two might not even
  be needed, if you're lucky) you should be able to run the X server, it
  just might not display as well as it could.  If by chance, you can't
  get the server working after performing the above steps, see the trou-
  bleshooting section.

  To get things looking just right, you'll want to do step three:

     o  Use xvidtune to improve the display

  All of these steps are explained in detail in the following sections.
  If you're in a real hurry you can probably skip the section explaining
  xf86config, because it's pretty good about explaining itself when you
  run it.


  3.  Running xf86config

  From a text screen, run the xf86config program.  This program should
  be run as root (although not absolutely necessary, it will allow
  xf86config to do more of the work for you).  You can press your
  interrupt character (usually Control-C or perhaps Delete), at any time
  to stop the program, if you need to.  You can just start it over
  again.

  The xf86config program provides instructions on screen as to what you
  need to do.  Following are some notes that document the various stages
  in the process. They should help you get through the process quickly
  and provide some documentation for those people who like to know what
  they're getting themselves into, before running a program.

  3.1.  The intro screen

  First, xf86config begins by telling you a few things like the fact
  that it can help you setup an XF86Config file or that you can do the
  job yourself with an editor.  Just read what it says and press Enter
  when done.

  3.2.  Getting your PATH right

  The program will next check that you have the directory /usr/X11R6
  (the standard installation directory) on your system and tell you that
  it needs to be in your PATH environment variable.

  It will also check if you have the /usr/X386 directory as used by
  older (pre 3.0) versions of XFree86.  If by chance you do, it will
  warn you that /usr/X11R6 must be before /usr/X386 in your PATH.

  If everything is okay, just press Enter and go on, otherwise press
  Control-C to exit and make any necessary changes and restart
  xf86config.

  3.3.  Mouse setup

  Pick the mouse type from the menu and enter the name of the device to
  which mouse is connected, as directed.

  If you are using an OS (e.g. SVR4, SCO) that has a built in mouse
  driver that the Xserver could use, you'll need to edit the XF86Config
  file to setup your mouse, so just pick any mouse from the list and
  press enter when asked for the device.

  If you don't know which protocol your mouse uses, you'll just have to
  guess (the xf86config program will give you some hints as to which
  might be most likely) and then see the troubleshooting section if it
  doesn't work when you run the server.

  3.4.  Keyboard setup

  Simply answer yes to the question regarding keyboard setup.

  If there is some reason you need to use the right-alt and control keys
  for something else, you can enter no.

  3.5.  Monitor setup

  Setting up a monitor consists of entering the specifications of your
  monitor and a description of the model and manufacturer.

  You are first asked for the horizontal sync rate.  It is VERY
  important to enter the correct value(s) from the manual. If one of the

  ranges given matches the rate of your monitor, then pick it, otherwise
  pick custom and enter the values from your manual.

  Next is the vertical refresh rate. Again, it is VERY important that
  this parameter be specified correctly.  Enter it in a manner similar
  to the horizontal sync rate.

  If either rate is mis-specified, it can result in damage to your
  monitor.

  Finally, you are asked for an "identifier", your monitor manufacturer,
  and model.  You can just press enter to get through these quickly.

  3.6.  Selecting your card

  You are next asked if you would like to view the database of cards.
  Picking your card from the list will cause the answers to the
  questions in the next two sections to be filled in for you and so can
  save a little time.

  If your card does not appear in the list, just press q and enter to
  skip on to the next step - where you'll have to answer the questions
  yourself.

  3.7.  Server selection

  If you selected your card in the previous step, then server selection
  is easy - just use the recommendation from the database.

  If you have a card which uses one of the chipsets for which a specific
  server exists (Mach8, Mach32, Mach64, AGX/XGA, 8514/A, S3, ET4000/W32,
  I128, P9000) you'll want to pick the accel option.

  Otherwise you'll probably want to use the SVGA server.

  Next, answer yes when the program asks if you want it to set the
  symbolic link for you.  If you picked the accel option, you'll also
  need to indicate which particular accelerated server to link to.

  3.8.  Screen/Video configuration

  Pick the appropriate option from the list to indicate the amount of
  memory on your video card.

  Then you are asked to provide and identifier, the manufacturer, and
  the model of your card.  You can just press enter to skip through
  these, if you wish.

  Next, the program will ask for the type of RAMDAC and Clockchip on
  your card.  If your card was in the database, you should just to tell
  it to use the values from the database.

  If you don't have one of the listed RAMDACs or Clockchips on your
  card, just press enter when asked what type you have.  If you do not
  have a programmable clock chip, the program will next attempt to probe
  to find out what clock rates are supported by your clock chip.

  3.9.  Mode Selection

  Now you get to tell the program which video modes you would like to be
  able to run.

  The program will show you the common modes that should work with your
  card (some might not work with your monitor, but if you've correctly
  specified the monitor's sync rates, the X server will just ignore them

  when it runs).

  You could just accept the settings as they are given, but you'll
  probably wish to reverse the order.  For example, if you have a card
  with 1 Meg RAM, it will list the modes


                       "640x480" "800x600" "1024x768" for 8bpp





  Select 1 to change the settings for 8bpp and the type 432 to select
  the reverse order.

  When you've select the modes, in the order you wish, select option 4
  to continue.

  3.10.  Creating the XF86Config file

  The program will now ask if you would like to write the configuration
  settings you've selected to the file XF86Config. Answer yes.

  3.11.  Some final notes

  Lastly, the program tells you that it's finished its part of this
  process and counsels you to check the file before using it.  The next
  section covers the changes that are most likely to be needed.

  4.  Fixing the XF86Config file

  Use an editor to look at the XF86Config file. Here are some things
  that may need to be changed:

     o  If you are running an operating system which has built-in mouse
        support, you'll want to change the Pointer section.
        Specifically, you should set the Protocol to OSMouse (SCO) or
        Xqueue (SVR4, some SVR3) and you should remove the Device line.

     o  If you are running a system with the Xqueue event driver and
        would like to use it, change the Protocol setting in the
        Keyboard section to Xqueue.

  Once you are satisfied that the configuration is correct, copy the
  XF86Config file to /usr/X11R6/lib/X11 and run the 'startx' command.

  You should now have a running X server.  If it's running but the
  display doesn't look as good as you think it should (i.e.  it doesn't
  fill the whole screen, it's off-center, it's wrapping around on one
  side, etc.) see the section on xvidtune.  If there is some other
  problem, see the troubleshooting section.

  5.  Running xvidtune

  If you need to make adjustments to the video display, xvidtune is the
  tool to use.

  Simply enter the command xvidtune from a shell prompt within an xterm.
  Read the warning and click on OK.  Next click on the Auto button.

  Now click on whatever combination of Up/Down/Left/Right
  Shorter/Taller/Wider/Narrower is need to adjust the display to your
  liking.


  If you are using a recent S3-based card there will be some extra
  buttons and entries at the bottom (InvertVCLK, EarlySC, and Blank
  Delays). These can help solve problems of the display wrapping around
  a few pixels.

  Once the display has been adjusted properly, press the show button to
  printout the correct ModeLine to put in the XF86Config to make the
  server always use the current display settings.  To aid in copying
  this information to your XF86Config file, the modeline is also made
  the current selection allowing you to just paste it into your editor.

  If you would like to adjust your other modes, you can click on the
  Next and Prev buttons to switch modes.

  When you are through using xvidtune simply press on the Quit button.

  6.  Troubleshooting

  Since you're reading this, something must not have gone the way you
  had hoped (or else you just really enjoy reading).

  Below are listed some common problems that may occur during
  configuration and some hints for solving them.  However, there are
  just too many different combinations of hardware and software
  configurations, and, well, just too many things that can go wrong, for
  this document and the tools it documents, to cover every case.

  If after trying the steps in the previous sections and checking the
  hints in this section, you still are unable to get your system
  working, you'll have to read the full documentation.  Read the README
  file for your card and OS (if they exist), the XFree86 Configuration
  Guide (README.Config), and the XF86Config man page.

  You should also look at the XFree86 FAQ <http://www.XFree86.org/FAQ>
  for more up-to-date information, especially if you are trying to
  configure a fairly new card.

  If all else fails, you can try posting a message to
  comp.windows.x.i386unix or comp.os.linux.x or send email to
  XFree86@XFree86.org.

  6.1.  The mouse doesn't move correctly, it stays in one area of the
  screen

  You've selected the wrong protocol for your mouse. Try a different
  one.

  6.2.  The server doesn't start, it says the mouse is busy.

  Well, it's probably right.  This most often happens on Linux systems
  that have gpm running.  Kill the gpm process and try startx again.

  6.3.  The middle button doesn't work.

  There's no easy answer to this one.  It's a lot of trial and error.
  You need to make sure you're running the right protocol for your
  mouse.

  Many three button mice are "dual protocol" which means that they have
  both a 2-button and 3-button mode. The way to get the mouse to switch
  into 3-button mode (which usually then uses MouseSystems protocol)
  varies between different models.

  You may need to slide a switch on the mouse or hold down the middle
  button when starting the server.  Other methods of switching modes can

  be done by the server, you just have to find the right combination of
  settings for your mouse.  See the Pointer section of the XF86Config
  man page for a complete list of settings.

  6.4.  The display is shifted to the left/right/top/bottom

  See the section on xvidtune.

  6.5.  I don't appear to have xf86config or xvidtune on my system

  Hmmm. Three possibilities:

     1. You have a version of XFree86 that is older than 3.1.2.  If this
        is the case then you probably aren't reading this document
        either, because it wasn't included in 3.1.2 and earlier
        releases.  Please upgrade to the latest version.

     2. Your PATH is not set correctly. Make sure it includes the bin
        directory for the XFree86 binaries (usually, /usr/X11R6/bin

     3. You don't have a complete installation of XFree86.  Go back to
        wherever you got XFree86 and get the missing pieces.
