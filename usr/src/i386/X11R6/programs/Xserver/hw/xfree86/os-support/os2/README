The old implementation of xfree86 used an undocumented device driver, SMVDD.SYS.
This has been replaced because this driver was not part of the OS/2 3.0 standard
distribution, and had very limited capabilities. For example, it did not allow mapping 
of linear frame buffers used by the new accelerated video cards. 
A device driver was written for this purpose by Holger Veit <Holger.Veit@gmd.de> 
which allows mapping of any physical address in user space (it also does plenty
of other usefull stuff.....)
The driver should be installed in the config.sys with a line:

DEVICE=path\XF86SUP.SYS

The driver is used for mapping video memory, as well as for granting access to IO ports,
and provides additional functionality.
