/* current status:

version 0.1

   This is basically very experimental.  Currently I am using it and have had
   no problems.  I was inspired to write this because I got tired of looking
   at XFree86 at 640x480.  Now I am looking at it at 1024x768.  If you want to
   try it, go ahead.  As expressed above, I make no claims of warranty,
   so if your machine blows up, you've been warned.

   I am releasing this right now because I was so damn tired of 640x480
   and wanted higher resolutions as soon as possible and figured others
   would as well

   I am still making modifications so I ask that if you use this,
   drop me a line so I can keep people up to date.

   If you modify this please inform me (especially if you had to modify it to
   get it to compile on your system) so I can put changes back into my version.

   If you know anything about programming the S3 please feel free to
   contact me if you have any suggestions about how I could do this better

   It works under Linux, and probably anything else XFree86 works on (I hope!)

   it has to be made suid root, as it has to call ioperm to use the video
   ports

/*
   the formula for the clock is

   freq desired  =  reference_freq * n  /  m * k

   reference_freq comes from the oscillator on the card (assume 14.31818 Mhz)
   n = N + 8
   m = M + 2
   k = 2^K

   we use N, M, K to program the chip

   the chrontel literature says: some values of N are restricted, including:
   0-7, 10-15, 19-23, 28-31, 37-39, 46-47, 55.  Why this is, I don't know.
   the 'including' remark makes me think there might be others, but they
   don't say which ones.  Notice that the ranges keep getting smaller
   ie: 0-7, 8 values are restricted.  10-15, 6 values are restricted.
   19-23, 5 values ; 28-31, 4 values; 37-39, 3 values; 46-47, 2; 55, 1
   if I have interpreted this pattern correctly, there aren't any other
   values, but then I could be wrong

   the chrontel literature also says use of M values of 10 or less for
   best circuit performance
