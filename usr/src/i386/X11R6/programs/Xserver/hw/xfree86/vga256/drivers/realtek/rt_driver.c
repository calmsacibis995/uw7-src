/*
 * RTVGAProbe --
 *
 * This is the function that makes a yes/no decision about whether or not
 * a chipset supported by this driver is present or not.  The server will
 * call each driver's probe function in sequence, until one returns TRUE
 * or they all fail.
 *
 * Pretty much any mechanism can be used to determine the presence of the
 * chipset.  If there is a BIOS signature (e.g. ATI, GVGA), it can be read
 * via /dev/mem on most OSs, but some OSs (e.g. Mach) require special
 * handling, and others (e.g. Amoeba) don't allow reading  the BIOS at
 * all.  Hence, this mechanism is discouraged, if other mechanisms can be
 * found.  If the BIOS-reading mechanism must be used, examine the ATI and
 * GVGA drivers for the special code that is needed.  Note that the BIOS 
 * base should not be assumed to be at 0xC0000 (although most are).  Use
 * 'vga256InfoRec.BIOSbase', which will pick up any changes the user may
 * have specified in the XF86Config file.
 *
 * The preferred mechanism for doing this is via register identification.
 * It is important not only the chipset is detected, but also to
 * ensure that other chipsets will not be falsely detected by the probe
 * (this is difficult, but something that the developer should strive for).  
 * For testing registers, there are a set of utility functions in the 
 * "compiler.h" header file.  A good place to find example probing code is
 * in the SuperProbe program, which uses algorithms from the "vgadoc2.zip"
 * package (available on most PC/vga FTP mirror sites, like ftp.uu.net and
 * wuarchive.wustl.edu).
 *
 * Once the chipset has been successfully detected, then the developer needs 
 * to do some other work to find memory, and clocks, etc, and do any other
 * driver-level data-structure initialization may need to be done.
