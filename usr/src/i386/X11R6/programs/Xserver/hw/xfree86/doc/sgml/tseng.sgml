<sect> Supported chipsets <p>
The Tseng chipsets supported by XFree86 are ET3000, ET4000, and
ET4000/W32.  At this time, the accelerated features of the ET4000/W32
are not supported; the chipset is treated as a standard ET4000.
For details about the accelerated ET4000/W32 server, refer to
<url name="README.W32" url="W32.html">.

<sect> Clock selection problems with some ET4000 boards <p>
XFree86 has some problems getting the clock selection right with some
ET4000 boards when the server is started from a high-resolution text mode.
The clock selection is always correct when the server is started from a
standard 80x25 text mode.

This problem is indicated when the reported clocks are different when the
server is started from the high-resolution text mode from what they are
when it is started from the 80x25 text mode.  To allow the server to work
correctly from the high-resolution text mode, there are some Option flags
that may be set in <tt>XF86Config</tt>.
To find out which flags to set, start the
server with the -probeonly flag from an 80x25 text mode and look at the
information printed by the server.  If the line:
<verb>
  VGAXXX: ET4000: Initial hibit state: low
</verb>
is printed, put the following in the SVGA, VGA16 and VGA2 sections of your
<tt>XF86Config</tt>:
<verb>
  Option "hibit_low"
</verb>
If the line:
<verb>
  VGAXXX: ET4000: Initial hibit state: high
</verb>
is printed, put the following in the SVGA, VGA16 and VGA2 sections of your
<tt>XF86Config</tt>:
<verb>
  Option "hibit_high"
</verb>

<sect> Text mode restore problems <p>
In XFree86 1.3, an option flag ``force_bits'' was provided as an experiment
to attempt to alleviate text-restoration problems that some people experienced.
We have now made the behavior of this option the default, hence the flag
has been removed.  Hopefully the past text-restoration problems are alleviated 
in XFree86 2.0.
