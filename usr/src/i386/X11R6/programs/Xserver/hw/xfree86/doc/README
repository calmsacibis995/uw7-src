  All of the above are supported in both 256 color and monochrome modes,
  with the exception of the Advance Logic, MX, Chips & Technology, Video
  7, ARK, RealTek chipsets, which are only supported in 256 color mode.

  Refer to the chipset-specific README files (currently for Cirrus,
  Tseng, Western Digital, ATI, ARK, Trident, Oak and Video 7) for more
  information about using those chipsets.

  The monochrome server also supports generic VGA cards, using 64k of
  video memory in a single bank, the Hercules monochrome card, the
  Hyundai HGC1280, Sigma LaserView, Visa and Apollo monochrome cards.
  On the Compaq AVGA, only 64k of video memory is supported for the
  monochrome server, and the GVGA has not been tested with more than
  64k.

  The VGA16 server supports memory banking with the ET4000, Trident,
  ATI, NCR, OAK and Cirrus 6420 chipsets allowing virtual display sizes
  up to about 1600x1200 (with 1MB of video memory).  For other chipsets

  the display size is limited to approximately 800x600.

  Note: The Diamond SpeedStar 24 (and possibly recent SpeedStar+) boards
  are NOT supported, even though they use the ET4000.  The Stealth 32
  which uses the ET4000/W32p is also not fully supported.  The Weitek
  9100 and 9130 chipsets are not supported (these are used on the
  Diamond Viper Pro and Viper SE boards).  Most other Diamond boards
  will work with this release of XFree86.  Diamond is now actively
  supporting The XFree86 Project, Inc.

  The Trident TGUI9440 series of chips is not yet supported, but we are
  working on this.

  Some types of the Mach64 cards are not fully supported.  Refer to
  README.Mach64 for details.

  5.  Important Changes between version 2.1.1 and 3.1

  There are a number of important user-visible changes between XFree86
  2.1.1 and XFree86 3.1.  The first is the default install location.
  The XFree86 distribution is now installed by default under /usr/X11R6
  instead of /usr/X386.  This moves away from the now out-dated "X386"
  name, and it also makes it possible for both versions to co-exist.

  The next major change is related to the server configuration file.
  The old Xconfig file has been replaced in XFree86 3.1 by an XF86Config
  file.  This is more than just a name change.  The new XF86Config file
  uses a format that is quite different from the old Xconfig file.  The
  new format is more structured, logical, and extensible than the old
  format.  We realise that the transition to this new format won't be
  without problems.  To help in this transition we have provided a
  program (`reconfig') to convert the old Xconfig format into the new
  XF86Config format.  This doesn't provide a perfect conversion mostly
  because the new format contains more information than the old format.
  Some manual editing will always be required.  One of the new types of
  information the XF86Config contains is a description of the monitor(s)
  you are using.  This addition allows the servers to check that the
  video modes are within the specifications of the monitor.

  For information about the new config file format and how to use it,
  refer to the XF86Config(4/5) and  reconfig(1) manual pages, and the
  README.Config file which can be found in /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/doc.

  Another change related to the config file is the locations the servers
  look for it in.  In previous releases the servers would look in places
  which could be specified by the user.  This raised a number of
  security concerns.  To address these, the server now only looks in
  places which are normally under the control of the system
  administrator.  For further details, refer to the XFree86(1) manual
  page.

  6.  Where to get more information

  Additional documentation is available in the XFree86(1),
  XF86Config(4/5), XF86_SVGA(1), XF86_Mono(1), XF86_VGA16(1),
  XF86_Accel(1) and xvidtune(1) manual pages.  In addition, several
  README files and tutorial documents are provided.  These are available
  in /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/doc in the binary distributions, and in
  xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/doc in the source distribution.

  The files README.Config and VideoModes.doc should be consulted for
  information on how to set up the XFree86 servers.  All supplied
  documents and manual pages should be read before contacting the
  XFree86 team for assistance.


  Documentation on SVGA driver development can be found in the directory
  /usr/X11R6/lib/Server/VGADriverDoc in the binary distribution, and in
  the directory xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/VGADriverDoc in the
  source distribution.

  If you are totally at a loss, you can contact the XFree86 Support Team
  at <XFree86@XFree86.Org>.  Before doing so, please make sure that you
  are using the latest release of XFree86.  Check the versions listed on
  ftp.xfree86.org:/pub/XFree86 <ftp://ftp.xfree86.org/pub/XFree86>.

  There is a Usenet news group comp.windows.x.i386unix that contains
  mostly discussions about XFree86 and related topics. Many questions
  can be answered there. The answers to common questions are found in
  the corresponding FAQ.

  9.  The XFree86 Project, Inc.

  The XFree86 Project, Inc, has been founded to accomplish two major
  goals:

     1. To provide a vehicle by which XFree86 can be represented in X
        Consortium, Inc, the organization responsible for the design,
        development, and release of The X Window System.

     2. To provide some basic funding for acquisition of facilities for
        ongoing XFree86 development, largely to consist of new video
        hardware and basic computing facilities.

  The first of these was the primary motivation.  We have held discus-
  sions with the X Consortium on and off for many months, attempting to
  find an avenue by which our loosely-organized free software project
  could be given a voice within the X Consortium.  The bylaws of the
  Consortium would not recognize such an organization.  After an initial
  investigation about funding, we decided to form our own corporation to
  provide the avenue we needed to meet the requirements of the X

  Consortium bylaws.

  By doing this, we were able to be involved in the beta-test interval
  for X11R6, and have contributed the majority of XFree86 to the X11R6
  core release.  The version of XFree86 in the initial X11R6 core is
  3.0.  The version of XFree86 in the current X11R6 patched release is
  3.1.1.  As time goes on, XFree86 will be involved with more of the
  development of The X Window System, as a full Consortium member.

  An additional benefit of this incorporation is that The XFree86
  Project, Inc has obtained outside financial support for our work.
  This will hopefully give us the freedom to be more pro-active in
  obtaining new video hardware, and enable us to release better products
  more quickly, as we will be able to go and get what we need, and get
  it into the hands of the people who can do the work.

  The current Board of Directors and Officers of the The XFree86
  Project, Inc, are:

     o  David Dawes, President and Secretary

     o  Dirk Hohndel, Vice-President

     o  Glenn Lai, Director

     o  Rich Murphey, Treasurer

     o  Jim Tsillas, Director

     o  Jon Tombs, Director

     o  David Wexelblat, Director

  Email to <BOD@XFree86.org> reaches the board of directors.

  Our bylaws have been crafted in such a way to ensure that XFree86 is
  and always will be a free software project.  There is no personal
  financial benefit to any member of the Core Team or any other XFree86
  participant.  All assets of the corporation remain with the
  corporation, and, in the event of the dissolution of the corporation,
  all assets will be turned over to the X Consortium, Inc.  It is hoped
  that by doing this, our corporation will be merely a formalization of
  what we have been doing in the past, rather than something entirely
  new.

  Here is a list of the organizations and individuals who have provided
  sponsorship to The XFree86 Project, Inc, either by financial
  contribution or by the donation of equipment and resources.  The
  XFree86 Project, Inc gratefully acknowledges these contributions, and
  hopes that we can do justice to them by continuing to release high-
  quality free software for the betterment of the Internet community as
  a whole.

     o  UUNET Communications Services, Inc. <http://www.uu.net/>

  UUNET Communications Services, Inc, deserves special mention.  This
  organization stepped forward and contributed the entire 1994 X Consor-
  tium membership fee on a moment's notice.  This single act ensured
  XFree86's involvement in X11R6.


     o  GUUG -- 1st German Linux Congress

  Also deserving of special mention are the organizers and attendees of
  the 1st German Linux Congress in Heidelberg.  Significant funding to

  The XFree86 Project has been provided from its proceeds.

  Refer to the README file under the specified directory for information
  on which files you need to get to build your distribution.

  Ensure that you are getting XFree86 3.1.2 - some of these sites may
  archive older releases as well.  Each binary distribution will contain
  a README file that describes what files you need to take from the
  archive, and which compile-time option selections were made when
  building the distribution.
