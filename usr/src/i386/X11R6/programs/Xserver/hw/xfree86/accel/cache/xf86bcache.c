/*
 * Adapted to XFree86 in X11R6 by Hans Nasten. ( nasten@everyware.se ).
 *
 * The cache memory is managed in a tree structure 4 levels deep.
 * At the top level is a CachePool structure, containing a linked list
 * of CacheRec structures.
 * There can be an arbitrary number of Cache Pools, each used for a
 * different purpose. ( font cache, stipple cache or pixmap cache ).
 * A CachePool structure is allocated on each call to the
 * xf86CreateCachePool function and a pointer to the CachePool struct is
 * returned to the caller. All other block allocator functions requires
 * this pointer as a argument in order to identify the Cache Pool to be
 * affected by the call.
 *
 * The list of Cacherec structures each points at a linked list of
 * BitMapRow structures describing a row of memory.
 * A CacheRec structure is allocated for each invocation of the
 * xf86AddToCachePool function and is then linked to the Cache Pool
 * identified by the Pool argument.
 * A CacheRec struct can be used for a single or an arbitrary number of
 * bitplanes. The caller supplies a 32-bit id number that is stored in
 * the various data structures and is passed on when doing callbacks to
 * hw driver code. ( the only callback from the block allocator is for
 * compacting a memory row. Callbacks from font cache code etc. must also
 * pass on this id number when appropriate ).
 * The block allocator does not use the id number internally, it's expected
 * use is to enable hw driver code to identify which bitplanes that are to
 * be affected by hw driver code.
 * 
 * Each BitMapRow structure contains a linked list of BitMapBlock structures
 * describing a row of cache memory.
 *
 * Each BitMapBlock structure describes a allocated piece of cache memory.
 * The BitMapBlock struct contains a reference field used when allowing the
 * cache allocator to reuse already used cache blocks. This is used by the
 * font cache code to let the cache allocator take care of keeping the most
 * recently used fonts in the cache. The higher layer ( font cache etc. ) has
 * to keep the lru field updated if this reallocation scheme is to work.
 * If the reference field is left untouched, ( it's initialized to NULL ),
 * the allocator does not attempt to reuse already allocated cache blocks.
