What is it?
-----------
SuperProbe is a program for Intel-based Unix machines.  It is used to 
determine the type of video hardware installed in the machine, including, 
where it can be determined, which specific chipset, what type of 
RAMDAC is attached, and how much video memory resides on the board.
The current version supports EISA/ISA/VLB machines running SVR3, 
SVR4, Linux, *BSD*, Minix-386, and Mach (MicroChannel and PCI machines 
are believed to work as well, although the BIOS checking may need to 
be disabled via the '-no_bios' option).  Adding support for other 
operating systems should be fairly trivial, as the OS dependencies are 
isolated to a single file for each OS.

Building
--------
Both an Imakefile and a standard Makefile are provided.  If you are using 
imake, you should be able to simply do:

	xmkmf -a
	make
	make install
	make install.man

If you are using the standard Makefile, edit the Makefile.std file to set
up the OS dependencies; then do:

	make -f Makefile.std
	make install

The program will need to be installed setuid-root on all of the currently
supported OSs.

Running
-------
See the SuperProbe.1 manual page.
