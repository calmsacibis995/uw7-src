 *	VIDEO7SetRead      - Set the read-bank pointer
 *	VIDEO7SetWrite     - Set the write-bank pointer
 *	VIDEO7SetReadWrite - Set both bank pointers to the same bank
 *
 * Most SVGA chipsets have two bank pointers - a read bank and a write bank.
 * In general, the server sets the read and write banks to the same bank,
 * via the SetReadWrite function.  For BitBlt operations, it is much more
 * efficient to use two banks independently.
 *
 * If the new chipset only has one bank pointer, then all three entry
 * points must still be defined, but they will be all the same function.
 * In this case, make sure the ChipUse2Banks field of the VIDEO7ChipRec is
 * set to FALSE in the video7_driver.c file.
