<sect>The Driver:<p>
The Video7 driver has only been tested on a Headland Technologies HT216-32
chip, but should work on other Video 7/Headland Technologies chips as
well.<p>

Currently this implementation of the video7 driver only supports single bank
mode, which can cause performance degradation, and makes no attempt to
distinguish between the different video7 chips.<p>

It also does not probe for memory, so in your <tt>XF86Config</tt> file, 
make sure that you use the following line:<p>
<verb>
	Videoram XXX
</verb>
Where XXX is the amount of RAM in your card. Most of them have at least
512k, so this is a good value to start with.<p>
Also, the clock probing function of XFree86 doesn't seem to correctly
get the clocks. The documentation I used (vgadoc3) suggests using the
following values for the <tt>Clocks line</tt> in your 
<tt>XF86Config</tt> file:
<verb>
	Clocks        25.175 28.322 30.000 32.514 34.000 36.000 38.000 40.000
</verb>
For 800x600 mode, use a dot clock of 38 instead of 36 or 40 as suggested in
most of the sample <tt>XF86Config</tt> files and <tt>modeDB.txt.</tt> 
This seems to be what is
used in the BIOS mode (0x69) which is the 800x600 in 256 colors.

<sect>Known bugs and What's been tested:<p>
<sect1>Known bugs:<p>
<enum>
<item>No video ram probing. Only known way to get this info is through
an INT 10 call, but you can't do this in a user process.<p>
<item>Clock probing. I'm not sure the docs in vgadoc3 are correct.<p>
<item>Random lockups with the SVGA server<p>
</enum>
<sect1>What's been tested:<p>
<enum>
<item>An HT216-32 chip.<p>
<item>800x600 mode and 640x480 mode<p>
<item>Mode switching and switching to text mode through <tt>CTRL-ALT-F1</tt><p>
<item>Only been tested on Linux.<p>
</enum>

<sect>Who to contact:<p>
	<bf>Craig Struble</bf> (<em/cstruble@acm.vt.edu/) Video 7 driver<p>
<sect>Acknowledgments<p>
<sect1>Thanks to:<p>
<itemize>
<item><bf/Cara Cocking/ for loving me and supporting me. Without her I'd
          be a bowl of jello.<p>
<item><bf/XFree86 team/ for the great stub code that allowed me to get this
	  going.<p>
<item><bf/Finn Thoegersen/ for compiling vgadoc3. Without this I would not
	  have had a clue.<p>
<item><bf/Harm Hanemaayer/ for the vga.c program in svgalib. Without this I
	  would not have had the breakthroughs I needed to get the thing
          up and running.<p>
</itemize>
<sect1>Other things I've already done:<p>
<quote>
	For Linux, I have a small patch to get the extended text modes to
	work on the Video 7 card.<p>
</quote>

<sect1>Things to do:<p>
<itemize>
<item>	Try dual banking mode.<p>
<item>	Write an svgalib driver.<p>
<item>	Go back to graduate school. (I'm a glutton for punishment.)<p>
</itemize>
