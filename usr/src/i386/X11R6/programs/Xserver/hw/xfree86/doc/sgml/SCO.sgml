</descrip></quote>

To obtain a minimum XFree86 installation you will require the archives
marked with a `*' above, the server binary best suited to your machine
and optionally "<tt>gunzip.Z</tt>".  All the files are compressed 
with "<tt>gzip</tt>" except
of course "<tt>gunzip.Z</tt>" which is compressed using the 
conventional <tt>compress</tt>
program.<p>

To install the XFree86 binaries just follow these steps.
<enum>
<item> Obtain the files you require.<p>   
      The rest of this procedure must be done as root.  If you do not run
      the extraction as root the permissions on the files will not be
      correct.  For example,  the `X' server is s-bit root and will not
      function correctly if extracted as an ordinary user.  <p>
<item> create a directory <tt>/usr/X11R6</tt>, permissions <tt>755</tt>
 should do nicely.
<item> cd <tt>/usr/X11R6</tt>
<item> extract the archives, for example:
<verb>
            gunzip < X312bin.tgz | tar xvf -
</verb>    
<item> if you have installed man pages see the later section on
       setting up man pages.
<item> Look through <tt>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/doc/INSTALL</tt>, 
	especially section 2
       on configuring and using XFree86.   This should allow you to get
       a server up and running.  Before starting the server check in
       the later section <ref id="sec-runxf86" name="Before Running XFree86">, 
	in this document, to
       see if there are any system requirements you have to make for the
       server to operate correctly.
</enum>

<sect>Source Distribution<p>

The SCO port comes as part of the standard XFree86 distribution.  Consult
the XFree86 <tt>README</tt> for more information on the location of sources.


<sect>Before Running XFree86<p><label id="sec-runxf86">

The SCO <tt/xterm/ terminfo description is not compatible with the <tt/xterm/
in the R5 distribution.<p>

To use a Bus/Keyboard or PS2 mouse you should configure the mouse drivers
under SCO as above using '<tt>mkdev mouse</tt>'. You may then use the 
<tt>OsMouse</tt> option
in your XF86Config to specify that XFree86 should use the SCO mouse drivers.
To do this, set the <tt>Protocol</tt> to "<tt>OsMouse</tt>" in the 
Pointer section of your
XF86Config file.  You can also use "<tt>OsMouse</tt>" for your 
serial mouse,
especially if you are having trouble getting your mouse to work using the
XFree86 mouse drivers.<p>

If you are using an Accelerated Localbus/EISA card you may wish to install
the "<tt>dmmap</tt>" driver.  This driver allows the server to use a linear 
address
mapping in high memory when accessing the card. The dmmap driver comes in
two forms, a binary archive which is supplied with the full binary
distribution and a source archive which is located in 
<tt>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/etc</tt>.
Both distributions provide instructions for installation/removal within the
<tt>README file</tt>. <p>

If you do not have the SCO TCP/IP package installed do not panic.
XFree86 will work fine without TCP/IP but you will most likely have to do
some or all of these things:
<itemize>           
      <item> Do not worry about errors from the X server complaining about
        ``/dev/socksys''.  The X server is configured to run on systems with
        and without TCP/IP.  This error is just pointing out that you do
        not have TCP/IP and that this method of connecting to the server
        has been disabled.
  
      <item> Do worry about errors involving ``/dev/spx'' or the ``sco''
	connection
        type.  This means something is wrong with the streams pipes that
        are used for connections on the local machine.  First be sure that
        your server has the ``s-bit'' set.  You can do this by running this
        command for the X server you are using:

                ls -al /usr/X11R6/bin/XF86_XXXXXX
  
        The output should contain the `s' character instead of the `x'
        character.  For example:
	<quote><verb>
-rwsr-xr-x   1 root     bin      1074060 Jul 24 11:54 XF86_W32
	</verb></quote>
        is correct while:
	<quote><verb>
-rwxr-xr-x   1 root     bin      1074060 Jul 24 11:54 XF86_W32
	</verb></quote>
        is not.
     
      <item> you may have to install streams into the kernel with
        ``mkdev streams''
        Check the SCO Manuals for more information on this.
      
      <item> you may have to configure some devices in /dev,  check in the
        "Trouble Shooting" section of this document for the entry which
        comments on ``/dev/spx'' and ``Xsco''.
        
      <item> Your streams resources may be configured too low.  You should check
        your streams parameters against the following values,  if the are
        higher then you do not need to changes them.  To check these
        values, login as root, change directory to ``/etc/conf/cf.d'' and
        then run ``./configure''. 

        Once you are running configure,  choose the ``Streams Data'' option  
        and step through the entries.  Just press &lt;ENTER&gt; at each prompt
        unless you want to change a value.  The values to look for,  and
        their minimum values, are:
             
	<quote><verb>
                   NSTREAM      128
                   NQUEUE       512
                   NBLK4096     4
                   NBLK2048     32
                   NBLK1024     32
                   NBLK512      32
                   NBLK256      64
                   NBLK128      256
                   NBLK64       256
                   NBLK16       256
                   NBLK4        128
                   NUMSP        128
	</verb></quote>
  
        You will not normally need to change any of these,  if however you
        do have to change some,  configure will confirm that you want to
        save the changes before exiting,  and will give you further
        instructions on rebuilding the unix kernel. 
  
      <item> Under SCO 3.2.4,  without TCP/IP installed the Screen Saver  
        extension behaves badly.  If your screen flickers between black and
        the correct screen as you move the mouse or type,  then you will
        have to turn the screen saver off.  To do this add a line like:
                   
	<quote><verb>
                    xset s off  
	</verb></quote>
                   
        To your startup script (ie., .startxrc, .xinitrc, ...).  This will
        turn the screen saver off and prevent the bug from occurring.
</itemize>
                   


<sect>Switching Consoles<p>

XFree86 uses similar console switching keys as the SCO R4 and R5
servers.  That is, <tt>Ctrl-PrntScr</tt> takes you to the next console along
from the one X is running on.  If this is the last console it will take
you to console 1.  Those interested in modifying the console switching
should look in <tt>xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/common/xf86Events.c</tt>.


<sect>Setting up Man Pages<p>

After compiling the tree, or after installing the binary distribution you
can get man to recognise the XFree86 man pages by adding 
<tt>/usr/X11R6/man</tt> to
the <tt>MANPATH</tt> in <tt>/etc/default/man</tt>, the line should 
look similar to:
<tscreen><verb>
    MANPATH=/usr/man:/usr/X11R6/man
</verb></tscreen>
This allows all users to view the X man pages.  You may change your own
<tt>MANPATH</tt> environment variable if you do not want everyone to access the
man pages.<p>

By default the man pages are compressed using "<tt>pack</tt>" under 3.2.2 and
"<tt>compress</tt>" under 3.2.4 to conserve space.  If you do not want to 
compress
the man pages change <tt>CompressManPages</tt> to <tt>NO</tt> in your 
<tt>xf86site.def</tt>.  Those
using the binary distribution can use "<tt>unpack</tt>" or 
"<tt>uncompress</tt>" as appropriate
to uncompress the man pages.


<sect>Using SCO binaries/servers.<p>

XFree86 will accept connections from SCO binaries (R3 upwards) and the
SCO R5 server will also accept connections from XFree86 binaries. This
means you may mix and match the two if you have ODT.  For example you may
still use the Motif window manager (mwm) if you prefer.


<sect>Compiling XFree86 under 3.2.2<p>

Currently XFree86 is configured to install under <tt>/usr/X11R6</tt>. 
The binary
distribution will be configured to go into this directory.  If you are
compiling your own XFree86 there is no reason why this cannot be changed.
Check in the X11 <tt>config/README</tt> on how to change your 
<tt>ProjectRoot</tt>.

The defaults are set such that you should only require minimal changes to
the <tt>site.def</tt> or the <tt>xf85site.def</tt> file.  
The <tt>BOOTSTRAPCFLAGS</tt> do most of the
work for you. The defaults will use gcc 2 or above and they also compile
for shared libraries and setup formatted man pages using compression. The
most likely Parameters you will be interested in changing are:
<enum>
<item>  What Fonts etc get compiled.
<item>  What gets installed (<tt>XdmConfig, FSConfig</tt>, &hellip)
</enum>
Use gcc, preferably 2.5.8 or later but an earlier version may still do the job.
Configure it with "<tt>./configure i386-*-sco</tt>".<p>

Make sure you do the fixincludes for gcc.<p>

In order to compile the current XFree86 version for SCO you will have to
create the following header files in the appropriate places.<p>
<enum>
<item> create a <tt>/usr/include/sys/uio.h</tt> containing the following:
<verb>
    #ifndef _XFREE86_UIO_
    #define _XFREE86_UIO_ 1

    #ifndef __IOVEC__
    #define __IOVEC__ 1
    typedef struct iovec {
        caddr_t iov_base;
        int iov_len;
    } iovec_t;
    #endif /* __IOVEC__ */

    #endif /* _XFREE86_UIO_ */
</verb>
</enum>
<p>
You also need to obtain a copy of <tt>libcrypt</tt> or the international crypt
supplement from SCO.  The supplement is available on the SCO ftp site,
<em/sosco.sco.com/ (The name may have changed) as an SLS, lng225.  This is
required for the correct compilation of "xdm".<p>

To compile from here, follow the XFree86 <tt>README</tt>, basically after
obtaining X11R6, applying the XFree86 patches and completing the above
changes you should only need to run:
<tscreen><verb>
    make BOOTSTRAPCFLAGS="-DSYSV -Di386 -DSCO" World
</verb></tscreen>
The install script <tt>mit/util/scripts/bsdinst.sh</tt> will not set 's' bit
permissions when installing over the top of a previously installed
XFree86. To fix this apply the following patch from the directory
containing the '<tt>mit</tt>' directory.  This is personal taste only, if you
are installing through symbolic links then leave this one alone.
<verb>

<sect>Compiling XFree86 under 3.2.4<p>

Compiling gcc2.5.8 is accomplished after doing the following.
<tscreen><verb>
    ./configure i386-*-sco3.2v4.2
</verb></tscreen>
<bf/DO NOT USE/ "<tt>./configure i386-*-sco</tt>" it will not work.<p>

Make sure you run the "<tt>make fix-includes</tt>" after you have installed.<p>

It is recommended that you use a gcc compiled without any changes to the
value of <tt>__STDC__</tt>.  Some people may have compiled gcc by 
adding the define
"<tt>-DSTDC_VALUE=0</tt>" to their <tt>CPP_PREDEFINES</tt> flag.  
If you have done this and
are able to recompile gcc without this change then you should.  Otherwise
refer to the end of this section for instructions on how to fix the XFree86
tree so that it will still compile.<p>


Compiling XFree86,
<enum>
<item> Check that you have a "<tt>sys/uio.h</tt>" as there have been reports of
    systems which have it and systems which don't!  If you already have
    one it need not be changed.  Otherwise see the 3.2.2 section above on
	how to create one.

<item> Check the paragraph on <tt>site.def/xf86site.def</tt> in the compiling for
    3.2.2 section.

<item> Add a <tt>-DSCO324</tt> to the <tt>BOOTSTRAPCFLAGS</tt> when you do the make World.
<verb>
        make BOOTSTRAPCFLAGS="-DSYSV -Di386 -DSCO -DSCO324" World
</verb>
    Under 3.2.4 several different options become activated.
<itemize>
<item>Compress is used instead of pack for compressing the man pages.
<item>The default compile line will contain <tt>-D_NO_PROTOTYPE</tt> instead
      of <tt>-DNO_PROTOTYPE</tt> as this is what 3.2.4 expects.
</itemize>
</enum>
<sect>Compiling with <tt>__STDC__=0</tt><p>

<bf>DO NOT</bf> make these changes unless you have gcc configured 
with <tt>STDC_VALUE=0</tt>.
You can test for this by compiling this small program.  If it prints out
<tt>STDC_VALUE=1</tt> do not make these changes.  If it prints out 
<tt>STDC_VALUE=0</tt> then
you will have to make the following changes.
<tscreen><verb>
    main() { printf("STDC_VALUE=%d\n", __STDC__); }
</verb></tscreen>
So now you have a gcc compiled with <tt>STDC_VALUE=0</tt> which 
cannot be recompiled
with a <tt>STDC_VALUE=</tt>1. To compile XFree86 with this compiler 
you will have to
edit <tt>mit/config/x386.cf</tt>.  Look for the pattern
<tt>GCC_STDC_VALUE</tt> and replace the
1 by a 0.  For example the line
<tscreen><verb>
    #define GCC_STDC_VALUE 1
</verb></tscreen>
should become,
<tscreen><verb>
    #define GCC_STDC_VALUE 0
</verb></tscreen>
It is recommended to use gcc compiled without the 
<tt>STDC_VALUE=0</tt> for building
XFree86.  It is, however, possible with the above changes.  These changes may
become obsolete or invalid in a later version of XFree86.<p>

<sect>Relevant Documentation<p>

Some relevant documentation for SCO Users and Developers can be found in
the following files.
<descrip>
<tag/README/       
the standard XFree86 <tt>README</tt> (<tt>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/doc</tt>)
<tag/README.SVR3/  Although a lot of this readme is based on Interactive
                   a substantial proportion is still relevant.
<tag>All of the VGA/Config documentation.</tag>
       <tt>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/doc/VideoModes.doc</tt> and the <tt>README</tt>
               files for particular video cards.
</descrip>

<sect>Known Problems<p>
<itemize>
<item>After running the server you may see some strange characters in your
input to the shell.  This is due to some unprocessed scancodes and is
of no concern.  This will be fixed in a future release.<p>
<item>Not all of the applications in <tt>/usr/X11R6/bin</tt> have 
been debugged.<p>
<item>Shared libraries are not implemented in XFree86 3.1 yet.  This means
the binaries use a log of disk space and a lot of memory<p>
</itemize>

<sect>Trouble Shooting<p>
<descrip>
<tag/Problem:/
<quote>
           The server does not start up,  and I cannot tell what is going
           wrong as it did not print any error messages.  
</quote>
<tag/Causes:/
<quote>
           There can be any number of causes why the server doesn't start.
           The first step is to find out what the server has to say.  To do
           this we have to catch the error output of the server into a file.
           This output contains a log of what the server is finding/doing as
           it starts up.  To get this output run:
	<verb>
               startx 2> /tmp/errs
	</verb>
           The output of the server will now be in "/tmp/errs".  You should
           look through this output for possible problems,  and then check
           here in this document for any references to the problems you are
           seeing.
</quote>
<tag/Problem:/
<quote>
           The server starts up,  the screen goes blank,  and I never see
           anything else.  It appears that my machine has hung.
</quote>
<tag/Causes:/
<quote>
           Again this can have many causes.  Most likely your XF86Config is
           wrong.  You should be able to kill the server by typing
           Ctrl-Alt-BackSpace,  if it is still running.  If this does not 
           restore your display then you may have to drive your system blind.
           Always keep another login running at the shell prompt so that you
           may switch to that screen and run commands even if you cannot see
           anything on the screen.  Try these things,  usually in the order
           given:
	<itemize>
                 <item>  log out of the login where you started ``X'' and then 
                    change consoles.  This will cause the SCO screen
                    switching code to try to reset the card.
                 <item>  run ``vidi v80x25'',  this command will also try to set
                    your card into a viewable mode.
                 <item>  shutdown the machine cleanly with ``shutdown'' and try
                    again.
	</itemize>
           When first trying to get XFree86 to run,  be sure to use a simple
           setup.  Get 640x480 working first then move on to higher
           resolutions.  Always trap the output of the server as shown earlier.
           Once you have the valid clocks for your video card (as provided
           in the server output),  hard code them into your XF86Config as  
           this will take some strain off your monitor during XFree86
           startup where it usually probes the various clock frequencies. 
           Getting the ``X'' screen to appear can be a painfully slow task.
           Be patient and read as much of the doco as you can handle.  You  
           will get it to work.

<enum>
	<item> Your system does not have the correct
              /etc/conf/pack.d/cn/class.h, You can confirm this by
              editing the file and looking for the string "SVGA", if it
              is not there then you should re-install this file from
              the "Extended Utilities" diskettes provided with your OS.
              If this is not possible then installing the "dmmap"
              driver from the distribution may allow the server to
              operate correctly.

	<item> You are using a server that requires special access to the
              video memory on your card.  The only way to fix this is to
              install the "dmmap" memory mapping driver for SCO.  The source
              for this driver is provided in /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/etc/dmmap.shar.
              For example, the ET4000W32 server will require this.

    This is most likely due to an incorrect <tt>XF86Config</tt> setup.

    Not enough or no pseudo ttys devices are present on your system.
    Depending on which version of SCO you are using you will have to do
    different things.<p>
<descrip>
<tag/3.2.2/   <tt>cd /etc/conf/cf.d; ./configure</tt> and increase

    This behaviour was observed when compiling with a

    mkshlib was core dumping on building the shared library in this case.
    Using a new gcc without the <tt>STDC_VALUE=0</tt> or using a

    appears to fix this problem.

    The SCO library is compiled with limited length identifiers.  To work

    if you don't have something like this (maybe called "Xsco") then create
    one and that should fix your problem.  As far as I can tell the streams
    pseudo tty driver should be there.<p>
    The simplest way to get the devices if you had to create this file is
    to rebuild the kernel and the environment.  If you don't want to do this
    then:
<verb>            
        touch /etc/.new_unix
        cd /etc/conf/bin
        ./idmkenv
 </verb> 
    and try it out.
