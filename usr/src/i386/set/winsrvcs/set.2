Some packages in this set require that you choose automatic or 
custom installation.

AUTOMATIC INSTALLATION
If you choose automatic installation, the UNIX System will make
assumptions about your computer and how you want the software 
package to be set up.

CUSTOM INSTALLATION
If you choose custom installation, you may tailor a package 
to match your computer and software needs. However, custom 
installation requires that you supply more information to the
installation.
