The UDK set cannot function correctly on UnixWare 2
unless the UW2compat package is installed.  The UW2compat
package contains updates to many system libraries and other
components needed to execute the "universal binaries" created
by the UDK.  On the Package Selection screen, you did not choose
to install UW2compat.  If you do not choose to install UW2compat
at this time, no other packages from the UDK set will be installed.
