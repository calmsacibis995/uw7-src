Your computer currently has older versions of the following packages
installed:

`if [ "$NSU" = "Y" ] ;then echo "    $NSUNAME"; fi`
`if [ "$ACP" = "Y" ] ;then echo "    $ACPNAME"; fi`

You did not select to install new versions of these packages.  However,
in order for your computer to work correctly, the new versions of these
packages will be installed.

Press 'ENTER' to continue:
.help
For detailed instructions, press the 'F1' (or '?') key at any time.

When you selected the packages to be installed on your computer, you
did not choose to install the following packages:

`if [ "$NSU" = "Y" ] ;then echo "    $NSUNAME"; fi`
`if [ "$ACP" = "Y" ] ;then echo "    $ACPNAME"; fi`

If the new versions of these packages are not installed, you will encounter
problems later on once the new UNIX System has been created.  In order to
avoid these problems, the new versions of these packages will be installed.
