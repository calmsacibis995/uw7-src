.title Help: Vtcl Runtime Package
ABOUT THIS PACKAGE
Vtcl is the scripting and rendering technology that provides 
the glue and User interface for most ScoAdmin managers.

It uses an architecture that separates the script
interpreter from an engine that provides that
actual rendering capability. It currently supports
character and Graphical (X/Motif) rendering.

Vtcl is an extension of tcl/tclX.  If you install this
package, you must also install the tclrun package.
