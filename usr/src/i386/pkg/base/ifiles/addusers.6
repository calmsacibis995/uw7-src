For detailed instructions, press the 'F1' (or '?') key at any time.

Each UNIX system has a user login that is designated to be the owner.
The owner will have permission to perform administrative tasks such as
adding new user accounts and network management.  The owner may give
permission to other user logins to accomplish these tasks by using the
User Setup facility in the Desktop Manager.

Please choose one of the existing logins and enter it on the form.
