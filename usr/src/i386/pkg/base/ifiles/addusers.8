available with the UNIX System.

After you proceed from this screen you will be able to access your computer.
Type a login ID at the "login:" prompt, followed by the password associated
with that login ID at the "password:" prompt. For your protection the

For detailed instructions, press the 'F1' (or '?') key at any time.

The Owner Account has been created, and your UNIX System is now ready
for your use.

You will see a "login:" prompt.  At this prompt, you can type a owner
account login followed by 'ENTER' to access your UNIX system.  This prompt
will be followed by the "password:" prompt.  You must type in the password
for this login followed by 'ENTER'.  The password you type will not be
displayed on the screen.  It must exactly match the password you originally
entered for this login.

If you should type the login incorrectly, you will still see the password
prompt before being told the login was incorrect.  You will then be prompted
again to enter a valid login and password.
