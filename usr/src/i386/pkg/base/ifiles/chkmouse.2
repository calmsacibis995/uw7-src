In order to use a serial mouse, you must tell the installation program which
serial port your mouse is connected to.  You must also indicate the number 
of buttons on your mouse.  If you are using a Mouse Systems Corporaton (MSC) 
compatible mouse, you must select Mouse Systems.  See the help facility or
the Installation Guide for more information.

Enter the following information about your serial mouse.

SERIAL PORT

In order for the UNIX System to properly handle your serial mouse, it must
know the serial port that you have the mouse attached to.  Refer to the
documentation that came with your computer to determine if your serial mouse
is attached to tty00 (also known as COM1) or tty01 (also known as COM2).

DEFAULT MOUSE TYPE
 
In most cases, UnixWare will autodetect the type of serial mouse attached
to your system.  The Mouse Systems mouse, cannot be autodetected.  To
avoid potential problems in using your mouse, you need to specify its
operational mode.

The Mouse Systems Corporation (MSC)-compatible mouse is a 3-button serial 
mouse similar to the Microsoft serial mouse.  Before selecting this mouse, 
make sure the mouse is configured to operate in MSC mode.  To select this
mode, locate the switch on the underside of the mouse and slide it to the
3-button or MSC mode.  If your MSC-compatible mouse does not fit this
description or you cannot locate the switch, follow the instructions
in the user documentation that came with the mouse.

Note:  The Mouse Systems or MSC mode is also known as "PC Mouse".

NUMBER OF MOUSE BUTTONS

When you use your mouse in the UNIX System's graphical user environment, you
will be able to use different buttons on the mouse for activities such as
drag-and-drop, double-clicking, and popping up menus.  Your mouse has either
two or three buttons; please select the correct number.

See the Installation Guide for more details.
