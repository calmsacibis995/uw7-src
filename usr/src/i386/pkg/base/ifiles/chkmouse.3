To use your Bus mouse, you must provide the interrupt vector that your Bus
mouse controller card is configured to use.  The choices given are those
that are not being used by other devices attached to your computer that the
UNIX System knows about.  You must also indicate the number of buttons on
your mouse.  See the Installation Guide for more information.
`[ "$MSEINT" ] && echo ""`
`[ "$MSEINT" ] && echo "The values shown below describe a bus mouse that was already configured\non this computer.  If you have not changed your mouse then you should accept\nthese values."`

Enter the following information about your bus mouse.

`[ "${CNT}" = "1" ] && echo "2 1//${IVN1}//    Interrupt Vector Number:  //MSEINT//"`

`[ "$MSEINT" ] && echo ""`
`[ "$MSEINT" ] && echo "The default values on this screen were used by a bus mouse that was\nattached to your original UNIX System.  If you have not changed your mouse\nthen you should accept these values."`

INTERRUPT VECTOR

In order to ensure that your Bus mouse functions properly with the UNIX
System it is important that the UNIX System know the interrupt vector
number that your Bus mouse controller card is configured to use.  This
is usually set by a jumper setting on the controller card itself.  If
the value entered here is incorrect then your bus mouse will not
function properly.

See the Installation Guide for more details.

NUMBER OF MOUSE BUTTONS

When you use your mouse in the UNIX System's graphical user environment, you
will be able to use different buttons on the mouse for activities such as
drag-and-drop, double-clicking, and popping up menus.  Your mouse has either
two or three buttons; please select the correct number.
