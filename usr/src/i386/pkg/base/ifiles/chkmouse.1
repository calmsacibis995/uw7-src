In order to use a mouse with the UNIX System, you must identify the type
of the mouse attached to your computer.  The UNIX System accepts three
different types of mice, serial, Bus and PS/2-compatible.  A serial mouse
attaches to a serial port on your computer.  A Bus mouse attaches to a
Bus mouse controller card that is inserted in one of the expansion slots of
your computer's mother board.  A PS/2-compatible mouse attaches to the
auxiliary keyboard controller port (if one exists) of your computer.

If you are not sure what type of mouse you have, refer to the
documentation that came with your mouse.

See the Installation Guide for more details.
