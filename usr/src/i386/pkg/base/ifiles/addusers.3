The UNIX System can support multiple users.  A user login ID and
password are required to gain access to the computer.  One user will be
the "owner" of the computer.  The owner account will have permission to
perform administrative tasks such as adding new user accounts and
managing the network.  Other user logins can be given permission to
accomplish these tasks using the User Setup facility in the Desktop Manager.

OWNER'S FIRST AND LAST NAME

Enter the owner's full name.  You may wish to include a room number or phone
number in addition to the owner's name.  You may use any printable
characters in this field except a colon (:).

OWNER'S LOGIN ID

Select a login ID to use at the "login:" prompt when the UNIX System is
completely installed.

A login ID must use lower-case letters and not contain any tabs or spaces.
Login IDs are often the user's initials, first or last name.  For example,
someone named Jane A. Smith could choose to use "jas", "jane" or even
"jsmith" as her login ID.

OWNER'S USER NUMBER

If this computer will be sharing files or folders with other computers
over a network, it is helpful for each computer to refer to the same
user with the same user number.  If the owner has an existing user number
on another UNIX System, then entering that number here will enable this
sharing.  If you do not know the owner's user number on the other computer,
the "id" command on that computer will give it to you.

If the owner does not have an account on another computer, accept the
default.
