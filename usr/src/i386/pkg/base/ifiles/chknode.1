Select a name for the computer. This should be a short name that will be
used to identify your computer. Please use only letters or numbers in the
name you type.

If you will be connecting your computer to a network of other UNIX Systems,
then it is important that the name specified here be unique to your
network.  See the help facility or the Installation Guide for more
information.

For detailed instructions, press the 'F1' (or '?') key at any time.

The computer name is the name by which other computers will refer to your
UNIX System.  Even if you do not anticipate connecting your system to any
type of network, it is still necessary to provide this name so that the
computer can identify itself.

If you will be exchanging electronic mail or other information with
other computers, then your computer name will be a part of your electronic
address.  For this reason it is recommended that the name be short
but meaningful.

In addition, no two computers on the same network may have the same name.
If you will be connecting your computer to a network then you should
check with your network administrator to verify that the name you wish
to use is not already being used by another system.
