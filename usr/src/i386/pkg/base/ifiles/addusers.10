Help: Owner's Password

Owner's Password
#.ll

F1=Help
.top
You now need to choose a password to restrict access to the
Owner's account that was just created.

You will be asked to enter the password twice after this screen.  The text
of the password will not appear on the screen when you type it.

Press 'ENTER' to continue.
.help
For detailed instructions, press the 'F1' (or '?') key at any time.

On the next screen, you will be asked to enter the password you have chosen
for the Owner's account.  The characters that you type will not appear on
the screen and you will be asked to type the password a second time to
verify your choice.

If the two passwords do not match, you will see a message that says:
       ERROR: They don't match.
       TO FIX: Try again.
You will be prompted again to enter and verify the password.  If you do
make a mistake, you will have two chances to type the passwords properly.
If the passwords still do not match, you will be prompted again the first
time you use the login.
