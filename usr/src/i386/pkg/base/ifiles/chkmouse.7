Either you didn't press a mouse button within 15 seconds of the mouse test
being invoked, or the mouse type you selected was not detected by the
computer.

At this point you can either go back to the mouse type selection screen or
select to shut the computer down so that you can check your mouse hardware.

.help
For detailed instructions, press the 'F1' (or '?') key at any time.

The computer was not able to detect any mouse movement or button
presses. This may be because:

(1) you didn't press a mouse button within 15 seconds
(2) the mouse configuration information you supplied is incorrect
(3) there is a problem with how the mouse hardware is connected
to the computer.

You may select to try again, which will bring you back to
the first screen, where you specify the type of mouse being used
(or none).

You may also choose to shut the computer down.  While the computer is
powered off, you can check that the mouse hardware is installed in the
computer properly.
