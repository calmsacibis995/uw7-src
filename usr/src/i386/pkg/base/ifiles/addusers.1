In addition to user accounts, the UNIX System contains a special account
known as the "root" account.  This account is the most powerful account on
a UNIX System.  You should now choose a password for this account.
Remember and guard it carefully.

You will be asked to enter the root password twice after this screen.
The text of the password will not appear on the screen when you type it.

For detailed instructions, press the 'F1' (or '?') key at any time.

In addition to user accounts, your UNIX System contains a special account
known as the "root" account.  This account is the most powerful account 
on the system since anyone using it has access to all the files on the 
computer.  For this reason, you will be required to enter a password to 
restrict access to this account.

On the next screen, you will be asked to enter the root password you have 
chosen.  The characters you type will not appear on the screen and you will 
be asked to type the password again to verify your choice.  The second 
prompt will be "Re-enter new password:".

If the two passwords do not match, you will see a message that says:

       ERROR: They don't match.
       TO FIX: Try again.

You will be prompted again to enter and verify the password.  If you
make a mistake, you will have two chances to type the passwords properly.  
If the passwords still do not match, you will need to select a password 
the first time you use the login.
