In order to successfully create a new user account, both a unique user
number and a unique user login must be specified.  The choices you have 
made overlap those currently in use on your computer.  You must select 
different values.

For detailed instructions, press the 'F1' (or '?') key at any time.

When a user login is created on your computer, it is assigned a unique user 
number.  This number cannot later be assigned to another user login nor can
a second number be assigned to the same login.  Because you are performing a 
non-destructive installation, some user logins already exist on your 
computer.  The new user login you are trying to create conflicts with one of 
the existing logins.

In the previous version of the UNIX System, the user login "`echo $ERRUID`" was
associated with the user id number "`echo $ERRUNUM\".  Please select \"$ERRUID\"` and
`echo \"$ERRUNUM\"` to recreate the old user login.

You will need to select a new user login and user number in order
to successfully create the account.
