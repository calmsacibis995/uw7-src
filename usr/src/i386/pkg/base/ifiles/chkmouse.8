Your mouse selection is ready to be tested.

you don't press a button within 15 seconds, the test will appear to fail.

For detailed instructions, press the 'F1' (or '?') key at any time.

The mouse you selected is ready to be tested.  The test is simple --
you move the mouse and an 'X' indicator on the screen follows the
mouse's motion.  When you are done, press one of the buttons on the
mouse to end the test.

There is a 15 second time limit on this test.  If your mouse selection is
not correct, or there is a problem with your mouse, then this time limit
will expire and the test will fail.  If your mouse was functioning but the
time limit expired before you pressed a mouse button, then please perform
the test again.
