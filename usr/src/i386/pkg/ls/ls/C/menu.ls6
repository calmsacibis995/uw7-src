The Language Supplement (LS) supports a number of countries.

SELECTING A COUNTRY
To select the country you require, use left and right arrow keys to
scroll through the menu. 

Press <Tab> to move cursor between menu fields. To validate your 
selection, move the cursor to "Apply" and press <Enter>. 

To reset the scrolling menu to its initial value, move the cursor 
to "Reset" and press <Enter>.

There are 33 countries to choose from. If no choice is suitable, 
select "None." This will configure the default environment, 
also known as the "C" locale.

INSTALLING LS
The Language Supplement will ensure that not only the
locale you require is installed, but all relevant locales as 
well (for example, any English-speaking country you select will 
install all locales that use English). 

Alternatively, you can choose to install the support for all 
countries available with this version of the LS.
