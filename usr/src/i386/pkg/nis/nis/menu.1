If you configure NIS, it will be started automatically during system startup
on this host. Be sure you understand the implications of running NIS 
as described in the NIS administrator's guide before proceeding with this 
configuration.

After answering all configuration questions, you will be given the 
opportunity to review your selections and either accept them and continue
installation or choose to go back and step through the configuration menus 
again. If after going through the configuration menus you decide that you 
do not wish to configure NIS at this time, simply do not accept the
configuration and you will be given the opportunity to cancel 
the the NIS configuration in a subsequent menu. NIS installation will
then proceed normally.
