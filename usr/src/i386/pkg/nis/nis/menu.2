`echo  "There are three ways to initialize NIS:\n1) a master server - This type of server will keep a master copy of all\n   of the NIS maps. If you only have one NIS server on your network,\n   designate this machine as the master server."`
`echo "\n2) a slave server - This type of server has a complete copy of the\n   master's set of  NIS maps. Whenever the master server's maps \n   are updated, it propagates the updates to the slave servers.\n   The existence of slave servers allows the system administrator to\n   evenly distribute the system load implied in answering NIS requests."`
`echo "\n3) a client - NIS clients request data from maps on the server.\n   NIS maps are not transferred to clients nor are updates to \n   maps, since a client will always request data\n"`

See the NIS Administrator's Guide for more information on choosing 
the NIS host type.
