If this machine is a NIS master server, enter the names of zero or more 
machines that will act as NIS servers for this domain. 

If this machine is a NIS slave server, enter the names of one or more 
machines that will act as NIS servers for this domain. 

Be sure that the machines you enter have entries in the /etc/inet/hosts file. 

For further information see the NIS Administrator's Guide.
