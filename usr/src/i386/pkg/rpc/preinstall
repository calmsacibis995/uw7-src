# This is required in case there is NOT a Driver_d.o in the package
# (which there is NOT in SVR4.2).  The is really designed to get
# rid of the old Version 4 Driver_d.o.
#
# If I don't do this, the postinstall script will end up linking
# the old Version 4 Driver_d.o to Driver.o and the new SVR4.2
# driver ends being moved into oblivion as Driver_i.o.
