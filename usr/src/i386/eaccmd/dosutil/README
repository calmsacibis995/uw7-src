	Overview of MS-DOS file transfer utilities for Unix
	====================================================

The following user commands are provided:

	- dosdir	(provide "MS-DOS" style directory listing)
	- dosls		(provide Unix style directory listing)
	- dosmkdir	(create "MS-DOS" directory)
	- dosrmdir	(delete "MS-DOS" directory)
	- dosrm		(delete "MS-DOS" file)
	- doscat	('cat' a file on an MS-DOS disk)
	- doscp		(copy files between Unix and MS-DOS file systems)
	- dosformat	(format a floppy disk for MS-DOS)

The commands operate on the following disk formats:

	3 1/2 inch MS-DOS (2 sided) floppies
	5 1/4 inch MS-DOS (1 or 2 sided) floppies
	MS-DOS Version 1.0 or later
	hard disks which contain a Bad Track Table

The commands which transfer data (doscp and doscat) handle newline
format conversion for text files. When transfering text files from
MS-DOS to Unix, CR characters are stripped. In the opposite direction
they are inserted before each LF character. Binary files are
unaffected. The optional -r flag to doscp and doscat can be used to
force "raw" transfer with no processing, regardless of the file type.

MS-DOS files and directories are referenced with the following syntax:

	device:path

As an example:

	/dev/fd0:/dev/mouse.sys

This refers to the file "mouse.sys" in the directory "\dev" on the
MS-DOS file system in /dev/fd0. Note that for convenience under Unix,
the '/' character is used as the MS-DOS pathname component separator.

The file /etc/default/msdos may be created on a system to alias device
names. For example if the file contains the following lines:

+	A=/dev/fd048ds9
+	B=/dev/fd148ds9
+	C=/dev/hd04
+	X=/dev/fd096ds15
+	Y=/dev/fd196ds15

then the mouse.sys example earlier could be written as:

	A:/dev/mouse.sys

+ When accessing the 48 tpi devices the media descriptor byte
+ of the DOS disk is read.  This media descriptor byte is checked
+ against the device that was specified on the command line and
+ if necessary the correct device is opened for future reading.
+ This will ensure that the correct device is always opened
+ for processing of DOS format disks.

+ These programs cooperate, and no two processes will access a single
+ DOS disk together.  For each DOS disk to be read or written, a
+ semaphore is created in /tmp, if it does not already exist.  These
+ semaphores are used to implement a simple readers/writers solution.

The command line syntax of the commands is generally simple.
Typically there are one or more Unix or MS-DOS files and/or
directories allowed. Doscat and doscp have optional -r flags
as mentioned above. Note that there is no wild card expansion
of names within the MS-DOS file system. Here are some examples:

doscat:

	doscat /dev/fd0:autoexec.bat

	doscat -r A:/config.sys /dir/devlist

dosdir:

	dosdir A: B:

	dosdir A:/bin B:/dev

dosls:

	dosls A: B:

	dosls A:/bin B:/dev

dosmkdir:

	dosmkdir A:/dir1 A:/dir2

	dosmkdir A:/a/b/c

dosrm:

	dosrm A:autoexec.bat

	dosrm A:/autoexec.bat

dosrmdir:

	dosrmdir A:/a/b

doscp:

	doscp *.c A:/src	(copy lots of Unix files to MS-DOS directory)

	doscp file.a A:/src/filex.asm

	doscp -r A:/config.sys ./dosfile

dosformat:

	dosformat A:

	dosformat -fq B:

		The '-f' switch formats without a preliminary prompt;
		the '-q' switch formats without progress messages.

	dosformat -v2 X:

		The '-v' switch formats, prompting for a volume label;
		the '-2' switch formats with 2 sectors per cluster
			 (default is 1 sector per cluster on 96/135tpi).
