The files that end in .idraw are idraw files. Idraw is a publicly available
program that lets you draw diagrams (like MacDraw). It saves it's data in
postscript format, so to print one you can just type 
"lp -o post modules.idraw".

You can do a network install of idraw from the machine "zerog". The
password is "swadmin".

The file ps_to_gif uses Image Magic to convert the postscript to a high
quality gif (it does antialiasing). It only works for modules.idraw, but
it would be easy to modify to handle isl.idraw too.
