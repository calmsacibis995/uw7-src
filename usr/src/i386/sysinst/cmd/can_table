# can_table
#
#
# This file contains a table describing individual "cans", "services", 
# and "packages", and the interdependencies between them.
# The table is meant to be edited by hand.
#
# 
# Canned configurations are collections of services (and possibly packages).
# Services are collections of packages.
#
#
# To define the list of absolutely required packages for installation:
#       REQUIRED_PKGS   base ls ...        
#
# To define the list of packages that should *never* be installed:
#       FORBIDDEN_PKGS  dshm osmp compaq nwsup nwsrv ... 
# Note:  REQUIRED_PKGS override FORBIDDEN_PKGS.
#
# To define a CAN, the format is:
#	CAN <shortname>
#		LABEL <ISL screen item label>
#		DESC  <ISL screen descriptive text, line1>
#		      <line2...>
#		SVCS  <shortnames of SERVICEs comprising this CAN>
#		PKGS  <shortnames of loose PACKAGEs also in this CAN>
# The SVCS field is now ignored and should be removed from CAN definitions.
# The PKGS field is required.
#
# To define a SERVICE, the format is:
#	SERVICE <shortname>
#		LABEL <ISL screen item label>
#		DESC  <ISL screen descriptive text, line1>
#		      <line2...>
#		PKGS  <shortnames of PACKAGEs comprising this SERVICE>
# The PKGS field is required.
#
# To define a PACKAGE, the format is:
#	PACKAGE <package name abbreviation (see "man 4 pkginfo")>
#		LABEL <ISL screen item label>
#		DESC  <ISL screen descriptive text, line1>
#		      <line2...>
#		PKGS  <shortnames of other PACKAGEs required by this PACKAGE>
# The PKGS field is present only when the package depends upon other packages.
# Note: The gen.pkg.table script automatically generates the pkg_table file
#       containing PACKAGE definitions.  
#       Should PACKAGEs ever be defined by hand in this can_table file?
#       What PACKAGE would not have a pkginfo file for gen.pkg.table to scan?
#
# Only DESC fields can span multiple lines.
# See header comments in the gen.can.ifile script for notes on 
# translated DESC fields in can_desc.* files.

# Design issues (things to do):
# Potential extensions to the format and/or content of this file 'can_table':
#
# 1)	Hand-crafted PACKAGE definitions: see Note above.
#	Impact on 'services' UI module:  low.
#
# 2)	Package incompatibility:
#		Some packages are incompatible with others.
#		If a new tag could be added to the PACKAGE definition
#			NOT_WITH <pkg ...>
#		and tranlated into 
#			pkg_not_with[pkg]="pkg ..."
#		telling the 'services' UI modules to present radio-buttons
#		rather than check-boxes in the package choice popup for
#		a given service.
#		Note that this solution works only if the incompatible packages
#		could be logically grouped into a single service which would
#		present its packages as a radio-buttons rather than check-boxes.
#		This is overly simplistic.  It is entirely likely that
#		incompatible packages would span services.
#	Impact on 'services' UI module:  high.
#
# 3)	Products represented as services:
#		Products are often collections of packages.  
#		If a product requires all its packages be installed,
#		then the product should be defined as its own SERVICE.
#		Currently there is no way to indicate that all of the packages
#		for a given service are required.
#		A new tag could be added to the SERVICE definition
#			ALL_PKGS_REQUIRED
#		and translated into 
#			svc_pkgs_req[99]=yes
#		For a service so marked, the 'services' UI module would 
#		never popup a package selector for that service; instead,
#		as that service is toggled on or off, all of its packages
#		would be selected or unselected.
#	Impact on 'services' UI module:  low.
#
# 4)	Product incompatibilities:
#		Just as a package can be incompatible with >=0 packages,
#		a service (product) could be incompatible with >=0 services,
#		and/or a service could be incompatible with >=0 packages.
#		Perhaps the NOT_WITH tag could be used for pkg-pkg, prod-prod
#		and prod-pkg, provided the shortnames are all unique.
#		How to preserve usability under such a scheme?
#		What happens if the user installs an incompatible package
#		after ISL?  Do packages check for this and spew warnings?
#		Unfortunately, while the user determines the order of packages
#		that are installed manually, the ISL might install packages
#		in an order that defeats any incompatibility checking done
#		by a given package.
#	Impact on 'services' UI module:  high.
