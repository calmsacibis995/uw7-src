If the media you want to install from (such as a
CD-ROM drive) does not appear in the list: 

1. Press <Del> to end the installation, then re-start the
   installation. 

2. When prompted to enter the DCU or auto-detect hardware,
   enter the DCU.  Verify that the driver is present. If 
   it is not, you may need to install another HBA or 
   driver disk.

3. In the DCU, configure the driver settings to match the 
   hardware's defaults or jumpered settings.

After you use the DCU to configure the driver correctly, the
hardware device should appear in the media list.
