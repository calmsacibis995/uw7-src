.title Device Configuration Utility (DCU) Help

Use this window to choose whether or not to enter the Device 
Configuration Utility (DCU).

The DCU configures software and hardware drivers for devices 
attached to your system. Many peripherals, such as internal 
CD-ROMs, are autodetected by the DCU. In this case, you do not 
need to enter the DCU. Other devices not detected
must be manually configured by entering the DCU and 
modifying the appropriate driver entries.

For the purposes of the installation, you should only add those 
items necessary to install the system, such as an external 
CD-ROM not autodetected by the system.  Then, after 
installation, you can run the DCU again to add additional 
devices (such as additional CD-ROMS or tape drives).

For detailed information on using the DCU and a hardware
checklist, see the Installation Guide. In addition, the DCU 
has its own help screens.

NOTE: You can only run the DCU once per installation
      session. If you incorrectly configure a device
      with the DCU, you will need to re-start the installation.
