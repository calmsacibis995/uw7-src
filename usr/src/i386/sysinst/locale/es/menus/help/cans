.title System Profile Help

Use the System Profile window to select a collection of software 
to install on your system.

Choosing a system profile automatically selects the correct 
services and packages to enable your system as a particular 
kind of server, and tunes your system for optimal performance.

For example, if you install an Internet Server, the correct 
services and packages, such as inet, nws, and others, are 
installed to allow you to serve TCP/IP and IPX/SPX networks 
from your system.

Once you highlight the desired system profile, you can also add 
or delete additional services and packages by pressing <F12>. Or, 
you can skip service and package customization by pressing <F10>.
