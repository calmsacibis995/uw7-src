.title Hard Disk Error Help

If you reached this help screen, one of several errors occurred:

      - the hard disk detected in your computer is too
        small to hold UnixWare

      - no hard disk was detected in your computer

      - the hard disk size could not be determined

In all of these instances, the installation cannot continue until 
you fix the problem.

If the disk is too small, you need to install UnixWare on another 
system or add a disk with enough free space.

If the disk was not detected or the size could not be determined, 
the HBA driver may not have been loaded or configured correctly. 
You may need to load another HBA disk or run the DCU to configure
the hard disk.
