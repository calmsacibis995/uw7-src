.title Host Bus Adapter (HBA) Help

Host Bus Adapter (HBA) drivers enable the system 
to access additional hardware devices, such as 
hard disks and CD-ROM drives.

You must load the HBA diskette that comes with your 
installation media. If you have additional driver 
diskettes, such as those supplied by other vendors, 
install them before installing the diskette provided 
by SCO.
