ABOUT THIS OPTION
Use the File Systems menu to check and change how file
systems are configured.

NOTE:  The Root, Swap, and Boot file systems cannot be
       deleted; you can add or delete other file systems.

SWAP SLICE
This slice contains data that runs the machine.  The swap
slice should be two times the size of your RAM.  Since this
slice does not contain files, the file system type cannot
be changed.
