The Network Information Service allows you to centrally administer
and update user accounts, groups, and other information on a local
network.

You reached this configuration screen because you selected
the Network Information Service package during the installation.

You must enter the following parameters:
____________________________________________________________________

NIS Type (choose one)  Master - the authoritative server for a
                       particular NIS domain. All changes to NIS
                       data are made on this system. This server 
                       may rely on slave servers to respond to
                       some or all NIS queries.

                       Slave - a server that can answer NIS 
                       requests, but which cannot have its data
                       files updated unless updated by the master
                       server.

                       Client - a system that consumes NIS data
                       but does not serve NIS information.

NIS domain             A domain name which may, but does not
                       necessarily, overlap with the Domain Name
                       Service name for the local network. All
                       servers and clients require this domain name.

NIS Slave Server       If you configure a master server, you can
                       specify up to three slave servers in your
                       domain by entering their IP addresses.

NIS Master Server      If you configure a slave server, you must
                       specify the master server by its IP address.
