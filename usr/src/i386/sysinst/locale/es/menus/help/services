.title Services Help

Use this window to select the services you want to install 
on your system. As you highlight each service, a description 
of that service appears in the window at the top of the screen.

If you previously chose a system profile, the appropriate services 
are already highlighted. Choose additional services by using the 
arrow keys or <Tab> to move to a desired service, then pressing 
<Space> to select it.

When you highlight a service, you must select and de-select its
component packages by pressing <F2> and choosing packages from
the list.

If you de-select a service required by the system profile you
chose previously, the service is indicated with a ">" sign. Your 
system profile will not be fully functional without this service
installed.
