.title Locale Help

Setting a locale determines how punctuation, currency, and 
other formats are displayed on your system.

The choices presented here are based on the zone you chose 
in the Zone window. If your locale is not present, move 
back to the Zone window by pressing <F9>, then choose a 
new zone.

The locale you choose also determines the keyboard choices 
presented in the next window.
