Choose to use the entire disk for UnixWare, erasing
data in any other partitions on your hard disk, or
to customize disk partitions on your hard disk.

If you choose to customize partitions, you can preserve
partitions and operating systems already on your disk, or 
make space for additional operating systems such as another
SCO UnixWare or SCO Openserver system.
