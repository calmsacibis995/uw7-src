.title Confirmation Help

Use this window to confirm that you want to run
the installation with the answers you provided.

This is your last chance to exit the installation
without modifying your hard disk. If you have not
backed up any desired data on your hard disk, you
should quit the installation at this time, back up
the system, and begin the installation process again.

If you want to save the responses you gave to the
installation prompts, to re-install this system or
to use as defaults for installing another system,
insert a formatted disk in the floppy drive and press
<F3>.

When you reinstall this or another system, you can
press <F3> at the Welcome window to load the stored
responses from the disk.
