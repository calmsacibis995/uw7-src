.title System Node Name Help

The system name is used by many programs, such as mail and 
networking programs, to identify your system to others on 
the network.

If you intend to use this system on a network, contact your 
network administrator to ensure that the name you choose is 
unique.

The system name must be an alphanumeric string of from 3 to 
63 characters. The only special character allowed is the
dash (-).
