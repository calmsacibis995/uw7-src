____________________________________________________________________

System IP Address:     The Internet address of the system, which
                       consists of four pairs of numbers in dotted 
                       notation.
                     
                       Example: 132.147.118.3

System Netmask:        An address that masks the network portion of
                       the system's IP address. For systems not on
                       subnets, use the default provided. If your
                       system is on a subnet, contact your network
                       administrator for the value to enter.

                       Example: 255.255.0.0

Broadcast Address:     An address that broadcasts to all systems on
                       the local network. This address masks the
                       host portion of the IP address.

                       Example: 132.147.255.255

Router IP Address:     This optional address specifies a system on
                       your network that handles packet routing and
                       forwarding.

Domain Name:           A name, such as "sco.com" or "usdot.gov",
                       assigned by a standards body to describe

Primary DNS Address    The IP address of the primary Domain Name
                       Service server for your zone. This parameter
                       is optional.

Other DNS Address      The IP address of another DNS server. This
                       parameter is optional.

Frame type             The type of framing performed by the network 
                       adapter driver determines the format which 
                       the network adapter hardware uses to transmit 
                       data across the physical network. The frame
                       type specified must match that found on
                       other segments of your network.
