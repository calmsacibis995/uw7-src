.title Help: File Systems Option -- Alt/Sector File System
ABOUT THIS OPTION
Use the File Systems menu to check and change how file
systems are configured.

ALT/SECTOR SLICE
The Alt/Sector slice contains a mapping of the bad blocks to
good blocks and is used by the disk driver.  The ALTS TABLE
slice must be at least one cylinder (1 MB on SCSI systems)
and have a slice file system type.

If your system suffers from frequent I/O errors, increasing
the size of the Alt/Sector slice may improve the system
reliability.

If your system or disk has its own alternate sector subsystem
(for example, a SCSI disk) then you can reduce the size of the
Alt/Sector slice.
