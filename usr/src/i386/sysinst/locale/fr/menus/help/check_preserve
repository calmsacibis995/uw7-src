Choose whether to preserve existing partitions and filesystems, or 
to customize the disk partitions and filesystems. If you choose to 
customize the disk, complete the partitions and filesystems 
checklists in the Installation Guide.

Preserve existing configuration
____________________________________________________________________

This option allows you to preserve:

        - other operating systems, such as DOS,
          which may exist on your system

        - certain non-root filesystems which
          exist in the UNIX partition

If you choose this option, UnixWare is installed in the active UNIX 
partition, replacing the root (/) and boot (/stand) filesystems, 
but retaining other compatible filesystems and partitions. 
Compatible filesystems are s5, ufs, and vxfs filesystems.

You may also preserve this data when customizing disk configuration, 
but the risk of error resulting in data loss is higher.

Customize disk configuration
____________________________________________________________________

This option allows you to selectively customize partitions and 
filesystems on your system. This can be as simple as specifying 
that UnixWare uses the whole disk with default filesystems, or as
complex as creating up to four partitions and modifying filesystem 
types, sizes, and options.
