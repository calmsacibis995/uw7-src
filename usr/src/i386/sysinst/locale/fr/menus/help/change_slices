.title Slices and Filesystems Help

You may want to customize slices to create separate
user filesystems, or to increase the amount of space
used for memory swapping on your system.

If you do not customize filesystems and slices,
default values are used.

You can also modify and add filesystems after installation
using the SCOadmin Filesystem Manager. See SCOhelp
for details.
