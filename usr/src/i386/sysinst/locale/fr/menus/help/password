.title Root Password Help

The root account, or superuser, has many privileges on the
system, such as the ability to start and stop any program,
or access any file or directory on the system regardless of
permissions. Therefore, great care should be taken to restrict
access to this account and password.

The password must be from 3-16 characters in length and must
contain at least one numeral.
