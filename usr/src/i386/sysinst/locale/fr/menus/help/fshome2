ABOUT THIS OPTION
Use the File Systems menu to check and change how file
systems are configured.

2ND HOME FILE SYSTEM
The second home (user) file system holds an additional
set of users' files.  It is used when there are two
different groups of users.  Having two home file systems
ensures that both user groups have their own area.
