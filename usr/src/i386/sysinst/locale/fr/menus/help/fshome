ABOUT THIS OPTION
Use the File Systems menu to check and change how file
systems are configured.

HOME FILE SYSTEM
The home (user) file system is used to hold users' files.
Creating this file system helps ensure that users don't
deplete all the space in the root file system.

If you have a second disk, the default setup creates
the home file system on the secondary disk.
