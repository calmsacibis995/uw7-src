.title Security Help

System security levels cover a wide range of topics,
including password validity and aging, system access controls, 
login and terminal use restrictions, and auditing levels.

Available security levels:
____________________________________________________________________

High (above C2) Choose this level, which blocks many
                networking services, when you have highly
                confidential data and many users.

Improved (C2)   Choose this level when you want to maintain
                a high degree of security but allow users 
                to share data more easily.

Traditional     Choose this level when you want to network
                easily with other UNIX systems.

Low             Choose this level for systems which are
                not widely or publicly accessed.

The system security level can never be increased, but it
can be reduced by using the relax(1M) command.  Therefore, it 
is best to start at the highest level of security you think
you will need, as you can lower the level as desired.
