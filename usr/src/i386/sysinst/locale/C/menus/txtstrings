                Monitor Type Selection

  UnixWare was not able to determine whether your computer 
  is equipped with a color or non-color (monochrome) monitor.  

  To ensure that you can read all the screens during installation, 
  UnixWare must know which type of monitor you have.

  On a color monitor this screen will show white text on a blue
  background.  Otherwise this should be considered a non-color
  monitor.  What type of monitor is attached to your computer?

  Your choices are:

  1. Color monitor.
  2. Non-color monitor.

  Please type \"1\" or \"2\" followed by \"ENTER\": "

 Performing a nondestructive installation to upgrade your UnixWare
 system will not automatically upgrade all the add-on products
 present on your disk.  For details on upgrading UnixWare on a
 system where add-on products are also present, please refer to
 the instructions provided on the SmartStart front-end CD about
 upgrading an existing UnixWare system.  In some cases, you will
 need to re-install new versions of these add-on software packages
 manually after the system upgrade completes.
"
ODM_UP_EXPLAIN="
  The UNIX system currently installed on your disk has the Veritas
  Online Data Manager (ODM) extensions installed.  To be able to do an
  upgrade installation you will need the \"ODM Upgrade Installation Utilities\"
  disk provided with the ODM package for $LONG_NAME, $VERSION.

  If you do not have the ODM upgrade floppy, you cannot perform an
  upgrade installation; you can either continue with a destructive 
  installation, or you can quit the installation process completely.
"
ODM_UP_EXPLAIN_BEM="
  The UnixWare system currently installed on your disk includes the Veritas
  Online Data Manager (ODM).  To perform an upgrade installation, you will
  need an activation key for version $VERSION of the Online Data Manager.

  If you did not purchase the new version of ODM (and therefore do not have
  the activation key), you cannot perform an upgrade installation; your
  options are either to continue with a destructive installation during
  which ODM is removed or to cancel the installation.
