.title Network Adapter Configuration Help

Configure your network adapter so that its
Interrupt Vector, memory addresses, and other
values match the software or jumpered settings
on the adapter. Also, ensure that these
values do not conflict with other devices on
the system.

Configuration parameters are highly dependent 
on the type of network adapter you are installing.
For information on these parameters, see the
Networking checklist in the Installation Guide
or your network adapter's documentation.
