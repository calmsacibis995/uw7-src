.title System Owner Help

The system owner is a special type of account with privileges 
similar to the root account. The system owner can run utilities 
to back up and restore files, change network configuration, and 
add users, among other tasks. Enter the following parameters:
________________________________________________________________

Name            The real-life name of the system owner.

Login name      The login of the system owner. This name
                must be between 3 and 8 characters long.

User ID (UID)   The UID associated with the system owner.
                The default UID is 101. You can change this
                to another UID if, for example, you want to
                match this account to one the owner has on
                another system.

                16 characters long and contain at least one
