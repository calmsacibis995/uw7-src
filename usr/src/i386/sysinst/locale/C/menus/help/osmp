.title "OS Multiprocessor Support Help"

OS Multiprocessor Support enables multiple processes, 
or multiple threads of execution within a single
process, to run simultaneously on separate processors 
in a single system. This can greatly enhance UnixWare 7
system performance.

Platform Support Modules, or PSMs, contain necessary
hardware support to enable OS multiprocessor support 
on a number of supported platforms.

Choose a supported platform, or, if you have a PSM
diskette from a non-listed vendor, select "Add-on
Platform Support Module Diskette". If prompted to
insert a PSM diskette, do so and press <Enter>.
