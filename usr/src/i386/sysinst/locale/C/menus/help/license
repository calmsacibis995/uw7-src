.title License Help

You can license your system, or obtain a 60-day evaluation
license by pressing <F8> to defer licensing.  You must 
purchase a license before the end of this period to 
continue using the system.

Your license number, license code, and optional license 
data are obtained from a printed Certificate of License and 
Authenticity provided in the box with your software, or 
from an online license generation web page maintained by 
your software vendor.

NOTE: Licenses for Free UnixWare 7, the non-commercial,
      single-user version of the operating system, are
      obtained from http://www.sco.com/offers.

The license number is a nine character string; the 
license code is an eight character string. The optional
license data field is only active when required, and 
can be up to 256 characters. All license information is
case-sensitive and should be entered exactly as it
appears on the printed or electronic license.

After you install the system, you should register your
software.  For more information, see the Installation
Guide or SCOhelp. 

NOTE: Free UnixWare 7 does not need to be registered.
