.title Network Adapter Detection Help

The UnixWare 7 installation allows you to configure
one network adapter during initial installation. 
If you reached this screen, it means that the installation
auto-detected one or more network board identifiers, or
chipsets, on your system, but cannot associate that 
chipset with a specific type of adapter.

Choose one of the network adapters from the list, or you 
can choose to ignore the detected adapter. If you choose
to ignore the detected adapter, you can select another
adapter to configure later in the installation.
