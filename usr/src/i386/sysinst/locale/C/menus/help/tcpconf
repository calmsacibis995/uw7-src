.title TCP/IP Configuration Help
You can choose to configure TCP/IP during the installation, or
defer this configuration by pressing <F8>. You cannot defer 
configuration if you intend to use a TCP/IP installation server.

If you defer configuration during the installation, use the
SCOadmin Network Configuration Manager to configure TCP/IP after
you install the system. See SCOhelp for details.

TCP/IP uses the following configuration parameters (optional 
parameters indicated; all others are required):

System IP Address      The Internet address of the system, which
                       consists of four integers in dotted 
                       notation.

System Netmask         An address that masks the network portion of
                       the system's IP address. For systems not on
                       subnets, use the default provided. If your
                       system is on a subnet, contact your network
                       administrator for the value to enter.

                       Example: 255.255.255.0

Broadcast Address      An address that broadcasts to all systems on
                       the local network. This address masks the
                       host portion of the IP address.

                       Example: 172.16.2.255

Router IP Address      This optional address specifies a system on
                       your network that handles packet routing and
                       forwarding.

Server IP Address      This address specifies the installation 
                       server from which you will install UnixWare.
                       It is only prompted for if you choose 
                       "TCP/IP Install Server" as your media choice.

Domain Name            A name, such as "sco.com" or "usdot.gov",
                       assigned by a standards body to describe
                       your domain.

Primary DNS Address    The IP address of the primary Domain Name
                       Service server for your zone. This parameter
                       is optional.

                       parameter is optional.

Frame Format           The type of framing performed by the network 
                       adapter driver determines the format which 
                       the network adapter hardware uses to transmit 
                       data across the physical network. The frame
                       type specified must match that found on
                       other segments of your network.
