.title IPX/SPX Configuration Help

You can choose to configure IPX/SPX during the installation, or
defer this configuration by pressing <F8>. You cannot defer
configuration if you intend to use a IPX/SPX installation server.

If you defer configuration during the installation, use the
SCOadmin Network Configuration Manager to configure IPX/SPX after
you install the system. See SCOhelp for details.

IPX Net Number   A number, in hexadecimal format, that identifies 
                 this segment of the local area network. This 
                 number must match the network number of other
                 systems on the network.

                 If set to 0 (zero), the system autoconfigures this
                 value on reboot if a network adapter is found and 
                 another system on the network is running IPX/SPX.

Frame Type       The type of framing performed by the network 
                 adapter driver determines the format which the 
                 network adapter hardware uses to transmit data 
                 across the physical network. The frame type 
                 specified must match that found on other segments 
                 of your network. Press <F2> to select from a
                 list of possible choices.

                 configured installation servers. The bracketed
                 number is the distance to the install server in
                 network segments.
