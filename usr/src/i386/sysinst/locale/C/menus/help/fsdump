ABOUT THIS OPTION
Use the File Systems menu to check and change how file
systems are configured.

DUMP SLICE
The dump slice contains no files but provides a storage
area where development or support personnel can store an
image of the running system.

The dump slice should be the size of your RAM.

If you choose to include the dump slice, select 'slice' as
the file system type.

If you do not want to include the dump slice, select 'off'
as the file system type.
