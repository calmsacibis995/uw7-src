.title Partitions Help

A partition is a division on your hard disk which contains an
operating system. Partitions may be further divided into slices
and filesystems, which you can configure later in the installation.

UnixWare 7 is installed in the first Active UNIX partition; this 
partition must be at least 80MB in size.

WARNING: If you change the size or starting block of a partition
         that contains pre-existing data, that data will be lost.
         Always be sure to back up all data before changing the
         partition table.

Partition types
____________________________________________________________________

DOS           Contains DOS systems after release 5.0. 

Other         Contains other operating systems, such as OS/2.

Pre-5.0 DOS   Contains DOS systems prior to release 5.0. This
              partition must be the first non-System partition
              on the system.

System        Contains hardware-specific data. If this partition
              appears in the partition table (always as partition
              1), do not remove it.

UNIX System   Contains UnixWare. You can define additional 
              UNIX partitions to contain SCO OpenServer, previous 
              releases of SCO UnixWare, or other versions of UNIX.

Editing the partition table
____________________________________________________________________

You can set the partition type, its status (Active or blank),
and either the percentage of the disk it comprises or its starting 
cylinder. If you enter either the starting cylinder or disk
percentage, the installation computes the other value for you.
