.title Media Verification Help

If you reached this screen, it means that either the media you 
inserted in the tape or CD-ROM drive is not the correct 
installation media, or that there was a problem reading the 
media or accessing the drive.

Remove the media from the drive, verify that it is the correct 
installation media, and reinsert it, making sure that the 
drive door is closed or latched correctly. Then press <Enter> 
to continue.
