If you previously installed UnixWare 7 on this 
system or another, then saved the responses you 
gave to installation prompts to a diskette,
you can use that diskette to quickly install
this system using the same values.

To do so, insert the Response Diskette in the 
floppy drive and press <F3>. The Response
Diskette values become the defaults used by
the installation.

Your vendor may have also provided a diskette
which fulfills the same purpose. If so, insert
this diskette instead of the Response Diskette.
