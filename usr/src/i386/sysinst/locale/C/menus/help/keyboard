.title Keyboard Help

Correctly setting the keyboard type enables you to access
the special characters, such as accented characters in
European languages, supported by your keyboard.

The list of available keyboards is based on the zone
and locale you chose earlier. If your keyboard type does
not exist, exit Help and press <F9> twice to move back
to the Zone window and enter a new zone.
