The foundation of corporate communication today is a solid mail and 
messaging system. This set of services allow you to build
comprehensive electronic mail systems that will allow you to send
electronic messages and associated attachments between individuals
inside and outside your organization.  Messaging services further
allow an organization to transform their e-mail system into a
backbone for Web forms, newsgroups, discussion groups, and event
scheduling.
