.title Disk Configuration Help

You can configure both a primary and an optional
secondary hard disk (if one was detected).

For each, you can choose to use the entire disk for 
UnixWare 7, erasing data in any other partitions,
or to customize disk partitions. For the secondary 
hard disk only, you can choose to not modify any 
data or partitions by choosing "Do not modify" 
from the <F2> list.

If you choose to customize the disk, then later
move back to this window, you can re-load your initial
configuration by choosing "Re-load partition information
from disk".
