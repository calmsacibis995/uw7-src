System security levels cover a wide range of topics,
including password validity and aging, system access controls, 
login and terminal use restrictions, and auditing levels.

Available security levels:
____________________________________________________________________

Low                Choose this level for systems which are
                   not widely or publicly accessed.

Traditional        Choose this level when you want to network
                   easily with other UNIX systems.

Improved (C2)      Choose this level when you want to maintain
                   a high degree of security but allow users 
                   to share data more easily.

High (Above C2)    Choose this level, which blocks many
                   networking services, when you have highly
                   confidential data and many users. 

                   If you choose High, remote access to
                   your system using telnet and rlogin is
                   disabled. To enable these services, choose
                   a lower security profile.

The system security level can never be increased, but it
can be reduced by using the relax(1M) command.  Therefore, it 
is best to start at the highest level of security you think
you will need, as you can lower the level as desired.
