.title Locale Help

Setting a locale determines how punctuation, currency, and 
other formats are displayed on your system. Generally, you
should choose the locale that is specific to your country
or region.

C and POSIX are special locales which, if applied, result
in a system that does not format numbers, sorts in ASCII
(rather than alphabetic) order, and does not support the 
special characters available in the geographic locales.

The choices presented here are based on the zone you chose 
in the Zone window. If your locale is not present, move 
back to the Zone window by pressing <F9>, then choose a 
new zone.

The locale you choose also determines the keyboard choices 
presented in the next window.
