.title Root Password Help

The root account, or superuser, has many privileges on the
system, such as the ability to start and stop any program,
or access any file or directory on the system regardless of
permissions. Therefore, great care should be taken to restrict
access to this account and password.

If you chose a High or Improved security level, this password 
is required, and must be between 3 and 16 characters long and 
contain at least one numeral. If you chose a Traditional or
Low security level, you can enter a null password or a 
password of less than 3 characters.
