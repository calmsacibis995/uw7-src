Use the Special Disk Operations window to indicate whether
or not you will:

         Overwrite pre-existing boot code

         Perform a scan of the active partition

         Reset disk geometry

WARNING: Some of these options may result in the loss of pre-existing
         data on your hard drive, including data in other (non-UNIX)
         partitions. Before using one of these options, see the
         Installation Guide or read the online help on the Disk
         Configuration Options window.
