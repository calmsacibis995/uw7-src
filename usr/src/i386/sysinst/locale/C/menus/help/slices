.title Configure Slices and Filesystems Help

A slice is a portion of a partition of a physical disk. Each 
slice may contain a filesystem, or may be a raw disk portion.

Several filesystems are required and may not be deleted:

   /            root filesystem
   /stand       boot filesystem
   /dev/swap    swap filesystem

Other filesystems, such as /home, /usr, and /tmp, may be created
as separate filesystems or may be part of the root filesystem.

The remainder of this help describes filesystem types,
available filesystems, and advanced configuration options.

Filesystem types
____________________________________________________________________

bfs     The boot filesystem, used by /dev/stand only.

memfs   The memory filesystem, used to contain temporary
        files in memory. Files in memfs filesystems are
        flushed at each system reboot.

s5      A simple filesystem type, provided for backward
        compatibility. s5 filesystems may not exceed 1GB
        in size.

slice   A raw disk slice, used to contain memory,
        dump images, and data maintained by applications

(Continued; press <PgDn>)
.page
        which require raw disk slices with no filesystem
        defined.

ufs     Another simple filesystem type, provided for 
        backward compatibility.

vxfs    The Veritas Journaling File System (VjFS(TM)).
        This filesystem, known for its speed, reliability,
        and recoverability, is the default filesystem for
        root and user filesystems.

NOTE:   When you choose either vxfs, s5, or ufs as your 
        filesystem type for the root filesystem (/), 
        do not use the two you did not choose for any 
        other filesystem. For example, if root is type 
        vxfs, do not set /home to s5.

Filesystems
____________________________________________________________________

/               Root filesystem

The foundation of the UnixWare directory structure.
This filesystem contains program files and system 
data.

/stand          Boot filesystem

Contains system start-up files; must be designated 
as type "bfs".

(Continued; press <PgDn>)
.page

/dev/swap       Swap slice

Contains memory pages needed for the system to run; 
must be designated as type "slice".

/home           User filesystem
/home2          Second user filesystem

These filesystems are used to hold user directories,
files, and data. Use this filesystem to prevent 
filling up the root filesystem.

/var            Installation data files

Contains data files and administrative information 
about installed software.

(Continued; press <PgDn>)
.page
/tmp            Temporary files
/var/tmp        Installation temporary files

Contains temporary files. If you do not want to
preserve these files across reboots and you want
to be able to use emergency recovery tools, choose
type "memfs".

/dev/dump       Dump slice

Provides a storage area for a system failure dump,
should your system fail. The dump slice should be 
the same size as the RAM on your system.

/dev/volprivate ODM filesystem

Ensures against data loss when the Online Data 
Manager is installed.
(Continued; press <PgDn>)
.page
ALT/SECTOR      Alternate sector mapping

Provides a mapping of bad blocks to good blocks
for use by the disk driver. If you use a SCSI disk,
this filesystem should be turned off.
____________________________________________________________________

Advanced filesystem configuration
____________________________________________________________________

By default, the maximum number of files in a filesystem
is 64K, to ensure compatibility with older applications.
The bfs, s5, ufs, and vxfs filesystem types allow you to
remove this limit, by pressing <F6> in the size field
and toggling the 64K limit to off.

(Continued; press <PgDn>)
.page

These same four filesystem types also have a default
block size. To view or change the default, press <F6>
in the size field, then <F2> in the block size field.

Filesystem notes
________________________________________________________

If you are planning on installing the Online Data 
Manager, create /dev/volprivate with a size of 1MB.

If you are using your system for software development,
you might want to increase the swap space over the 
default shown.

You can add swap space and additional filesystems after
installing the system. For more information, see 
SCOhelp.
