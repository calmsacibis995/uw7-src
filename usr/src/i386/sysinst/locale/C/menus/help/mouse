.title Mouse Configuration Help

Configuring a mouse allows you to use all of the
functionality provided by desktop applications.

Select a mouse type to configure from the list
(Serial, Bus, or PS/2 Compatible) and press <Enter>.
Then, select the number of keys on your mouse by
pressing <F2> to toggle between selections. After you 
press <Enter> again, you have 15 seconds to verify
that the mouse is functioning correctly during the 
mouse test.

If the mouse is configured correctly, press <F10>
to continue. Otherwise, you can re-configure the
mouse by making another selection, then testing 
your configuration again. Press <F10> when you are
done configuring the mouse.
