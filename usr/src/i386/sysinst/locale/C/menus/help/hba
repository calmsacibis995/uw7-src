.title Host Bus Adapter (HBA) Help

Host Bus Adapter (HBA) drivers enable the system 
to access additional hardware devices, such as 
hard disks and CD-ROM drives.

Standard HBA drivers are loaded transparently 
from the installation media you inserted earlier. 
If your vendor supplied you with one or more HBA 
diskettes, load them now. Otherwise, choose to 
proceed with the installation.
