#ident  "@(#)install_map	15.1    %D"

#
# This file is dotted in by a ksh script (sequencer).
# It is also parsed by the do_install script.
#
# Yes, I know. There is only one module. So having a whole sequencer is
# overkill. But, in the future there will be many install modules.
# For example, the license ui module gathers information. We should have
# an install module license2, which writes the data to a nodelock file.
# It would be a very small module. This would mean that the entire license
# policy is contained in two files. If we need to change it, we just modify
# the two files, and don't have to worry about side effects on the install
# its self.
#
# NOTE: The install and ui modules are in different directories. So you may
#	be tempted to use the same name twice. Don't. Due to the debugging
# 	variables, the skip variables and the debug logfiles, the names are 
#	effectivly in one shared namespace.

# The first module to run

start_module=inst

#
# Stop when this module is reached (it is not run).

stop_module=install_done

#
# Where are the modules?
#
module_path=/isl/install_modules

#
# Define the state transitions.

inst[$NEXT]=install_done
