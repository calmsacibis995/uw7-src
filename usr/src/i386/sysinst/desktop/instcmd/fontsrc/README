This directory contains VGA (8x16) and EGA (8x14) font tables for various
character sets.

	850.8x14	IBM 850 (EGA)
	850.8x16	IBM 850 (VGA)
	font8x14	?? (EGA)
	font8x16	?? (VGA)
	iso.8x14	ISO 8859-1 (EGA)
	iso.8x16	ISO 8859-1 (VGA)
	isr.8x14	?? (EGA)
	isr.8x16	?? (VGA)
	nor.8x14	?? (EGA)
	nor.8x16	?? (VGA)
	por.8x14	?? (EGA)
	por.8x16	?? (VGA)

It also includes some bit-map files that can be used to overlay characters on
top of a character set.

	gr.8x14.orig	box-drawing characters (EGA)
	gr.8x16.orig	box-drawing characters (VGA)
	gr.8x14		mostly box-drawing characters (EGA)
	gr.8x16		mostly box-drawing characters (VGA)

The bmgr command (Bit-Map GeneratoR) takes as input a bit-map file (like
gr.8x16) and produces a binary file.

The fcomp command (Font Compiler) reads in the font tables for a font (like
iso.8x14 and iso.8x16), and it reads in the bit-map files that bmgr has
generated.  It then overlays the bit-maps on top of the font table starting at
character 0x80 (decimal 128).

gr.8x14 is the same as gr.8x14.orig, except that the first character is a
stipple character (0xb0 (decimal 176) in IBM 850) instead of a box drawing
character.  Likewise for gr.8x16 and gr.8x16.orig.

The file usr/src/common/cmd/winxksh/libwin/scr_init makes use of the fact that
gr.8x14 and gr.8x16 contain a stipple character at location 0x80 (decimal 128).
