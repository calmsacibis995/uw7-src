# Also, don't copy INITSTATE; it's used to control ISL behavior.
#
# Process any bootparms that are meant to be ivar variables.
# If, at the boot: prompt, the user types in ivar_foo="bar",
# then we should set the ivar variable foo to bar. This
# allows hand-modification of the install flow. These also do
# not get copied to /stand/boot.
